%% READ THESE RULES FIRST BEFORE MODIFYING THIS FILE
%% 1. Keep the entries sorted.
%% 2. Check that what you are adding has not been added already with a
%%    different name.
%% 3. Do not add a separate string for the title of the proceedings. 
%%    There should be just one Proceedings entry for each book, 
%%    so there is no need. Please help to remove them.
%% 4. 'booktitle' is the title that appears in the crossreferences, 
%%    'title' is the title that appears when the book is cited directly. 
%%    Normally, the latter is longer than the former, but they might be the
%%     same.
%% 5. The 'address' field of Proceedings refers to the location of the
%%    proceedings. Do not use the address of the publisher. The publisher 
%%    field should be constructed by joining the -pub and -ad forms like: 
%%       publisher = ams-pub # ", " # ams-ad,
%%       publisher = springer-lncs
%% 6. Always use quotes "" instead of braces {} for the string definition.
%% Z. Some of the entries do not follow the above rules.
%%    Please help us to update them little by little.
