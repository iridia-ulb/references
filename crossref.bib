%% READ THESE RULES FIRST BEFORE MODIFYING THIS FILE
%% 1. Keep the entries sorted.
%% 2. Check that what you are adding has not been added already with a
%%    different name.
%% 3. 'booktitle' is the title that appears in the crossreferences, 
%%    'title' is the title that appears when the book is cited directly. 
%%    Normally, the latter is longer than the former, but they might be the
%%    same.
%% 4. Ideally, a separate string should be defined in abbrev.bib to be used as
%%    the  booktitle of proceedings (whatever its format Book, Proceedings,
%%    etc). This allows to override long titles with shorter versions by
%%    adding the short version to abbrevshort.bib and including it after
%%    abbrev.bib. However, since this is quite extra work for a very unusual
%%    case, we currently do not enforce this rule unless you want to replace
%%    a long title with a shorter version.
%% 5. The 'address' field of Proceedings refers to the location of the
%%    proceedings. Do not use the address of the publisher. The publisher 
%%    field should be constructed by joining the -pub and -ad forms like: 
%%       publisher = ams-pub # ", " # ams-ad,
%% 6. Always use quotes "" instead of braces {} for the string definition.
%% 7. Proceedings published as books (e.g., LNCS) should use the type Book
%%    and not the type Proceedings.
%% Z. Some of the entries do not follow the above rules.
%%    Please help us to update them little by little.
