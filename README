This file explains how to use and modify the IRIDIA BibTeX Repository.

Before modifying any file, please read and follow the instructions at
the top of each file.

Format of keys
--------------

When any bib entry is added, the key should be constructed following
these rules:

1. Use the first three letters of the first surname of each author, up
   to the third author.

   Examples: Stuetzle and Dorigo -> StuDor
             Aho and Hopcroft and Ullman -> AhoHopUll
             Bleuler and Laumanns and Thiele and Zitzler -> BleLauThi

2. Use the two last digits of the date of publication (if this is not
   known, make a good guess because this should not be changed
   afterwards).

3. If there is a conflict, use another distinct single word, either
   from the title of the paper, or the title of the proceedings.

4. Exceptions are:

   * Proceedings: keys should be the acronym of the proceedings
     followed by the year. Example: ANTS2001

   * Technical Reports: use the identificative key that technical
     reports often have, for example IRIDIA-2009-015.
   
   * Theses (PhD, etc): after the year, add the type of thesis.


Contributing to the IRIDIA BibTeX Repository
--------------------------------------------

You should submit patches to bib-patches@iridia.ulb.ac.be 

People with a SVN account are able to commit changes. Any changes
should still be submitted to bib-patches@iridia.ulb.ac.be.

Before committing any change, follow first "Updating your working
copy", then use

 svn diff

to check that your local changes are really what you want to
commit. Please do not commit changes that do not follow the rules
described above and within each bib file.

Changes may be committed with any of the following commands:

    svn ci -F log_message
    svn ci --editor-cmd EDITOR

The commit message (log message) should follow the GNU Coding
Standards:

YEAR-MONTH-DAY  NAME  <EMAIL>

 * file (entry): What changed.

Example:

2009-11-01  Manuel López-Ibáñez <manuel.lopez-ibanez@ulb.ac.be>

  * biblio.bib (AngWoo09): New entry.
  (Asch01tsptw): Update year.
  * crossref.bib (GECCO2000): Fix editor names.


IMPORTANT: If you use non-ASCII characters BE SURE that your editor
uses UTF8 encoding. Otherwise, DO NOT USE non-ASCII characters.


Using the IRIDIA BibTeX Repository
----------------------------------

To use the *.bib files, you need to keep a copy (or a symbolic link)
in the directory of your paper and use the following line in your main
.tex file:

 \bibliography{abbrev,journals,authors,biblio,crossref}

There are three methods to keep your copy of the files in sync with
the IRIDIA BibTeX Repository:


 * Method A (if you do not use subversion for your paper)

1. Checkout a copy of the files to the directory of the paper.

   svn co https://iridia-dev.ulb.ac.be/projects/optbib/svn/ .

2. See the sections "Updating", "Contributing", and "Before
   Submitting a paper".


 * Method B (if you do use subversion for your paper)

1. Checkout a copy of the files to some directory. This directory is
   your working copy.

   svn co https://iridia-dev.ulb.ac.be/projects/optbib/svn/ bib

2. Then copy all *.bib files to the directory of your paper. If you
   instead create symbolic links (see ln --help), you do not need to
   copy files back and forth between directories to keep them in sync.

3. If you copy the files, you will have to copy the files again to the
   directory of your paper after "Updating your working copy".

4. Similarly, you will have to copy the files from the directory of
   your paper to your working copy before following the instructions
   described in "Contributing".


 * Method C (svn:external)

Read about svn:external in the Subversion book:

     http://svnbook.red-bean.com/


Updating your working copy
--------------------------

You may update your working copy with the changes in the repository with the
following command:

  svn up

This will change your local files and you may need to resolve
conflicts between your changes and the changes in the repository. To
resolve a conflict, edit the file, look for markers such as:

>>>>
my change
---------
the repository change
<<<<<

Remove the incorrect text and the markers and run

  svn resolved filename


Before submitting a paper
-------------------------

It is preferable that you do not submit all *.bib files. Use the
program aux2bib to generate a BibTeX file with only the entries that
you are using. 

If you find a mistake on the generated file or want to add new
entries, you should modify your working copy, and then run aux2bib
again to regenerate the file.

Some bibtex styles generate separated entries for cross references. To
avoid this use `bibtex -min-crossrefs=9000'.


List of most often used Subversion commands
-------------------------------------------

* Checkout a copy of the files to some directory:

   svn co https://iridia-dev.ulb.ac.be/projects/optbib/svn/

* See changes in the repository before updating:

  svn diff -rBASE:HEAD https://iridia-dev.ulb.ac.be/projects/optbib/svn/

* Update your local copy with the changes in the repository

  svn up

* See your local changes

  svn diff

* Commit changes:

  svn ci -F log_message
  or
  svn ci --editor-cmd EDITOR
