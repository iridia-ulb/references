%% READ THESE RULES FIRST BEFORE MODIFYING THIS FILE
%% 1. This file should only contain 'article' entries.
%% 2. Keep the entries sorted with respect to the key.
%% 3. Check that what you are adding has not been added already with a
%%    different key.
%% 4. 'author' and 'editor' fields should be taken from authors.bib.
%% 5. 'publishers', 'series' and 'institution' should be taken from abbrev.bib.
%% 6. 'journal' should be taken from journal.bib.
%% 7. The 'alias' field is used when a repeated entry is found.
%%    Delete one and add its key as the alias field of the other.
%%    This helps to locate entries that have been renamed or deleted.
%% 8. Since some bib-styles mandate title-case but others mandate sentence-case
%%    and converting from title-case to sentence-case is done automatically but
%%    the opposite cannot be done, then titles should preferably be in
%%    title-case like "Data Structures and Algorithms". If a word or a letter
%%    should always be in upper (or lower) case, then surround them with
%%    braces, like in "The {ACO} Book", or "The {Pareto} Front".
%% 9. Braces can prevent kerning between letters, so it is in general
%%    preferable to enclose entire words and not just single letters in braces
%%    to protect them.
%%10. The fields 'pdf', 'supplement', and 'epub' can be used to point out to a
%%    preferred PDF filename, a url containing supplementary material and a url
%%    containing the document, respectively.  These fields will be ignored by
%%    most BibTeX styles (.bst files), but they can be used with custom styles
%%    to, for example, generate an HTML bibliography, a list of publications.
%%    See testbib.tex for an example.
%%11. If you wish to add an entry for supplementary material to another
%%    publication, please use a Misc entry with the same label as for the main
%%    publication adding -supp at the end. Example: the supplementary material
%%    entry for BezLopStu2012:ants would be BezLopStu2012:ants-supp.
%%    This keeps the entries together, making easier to keep them in sync.
%%12. Use the following abbreviations for months: jan, feb, mar, apr, may, jun,
%%    jul, aug, sep, oct, nov, dec. Some bibstyles will abbreviate the months,
%%    others may use numeric values and others will use the full name. Using
%%    the abbreviations allows this customization to be consistent.
%%13. biblatex warns if 'month' field contains more than one month.
%%    Use the 'date' field in that case.
%% Z. Some of the entries do not follow the above rules.
%%    Please help us to update them little by little.

                  multiobjective optimization problems, because they allow a
                  decision-maker to provide her/his preference information
                  iteratively in a comfortable way at the same time as (s)he
                  learns about all different aspects of the problem. A wide
                  variety of interactive methods is nowadays available, and
                  they differ from each other in both technical aspects and
                  type of preference information employed. Therefore, assessing
                  the performance of interactive methods can help users to
                  choose the most appropriate one for a given problem. This is
                  a challenging task, which has been tackled from different
                  perspectives in the published literature. We present a
                  bibliographic survey of papers where interactive
                  multiobjective optimization methods have been assessed
                  (either individually or compared to other methods). Besides
                  other features, we collect information about the type of
                  decision-maker involved (utility or value functions,
                  artificial or human decision-maker), the type of preference
                  information provided, and aspects of interactive methods that
                  were somehow measured. Based on the survey and on our own
                  experiences, we identify a series of desirable properties of
                  interactive methods that we believe should be assessed.},

                  and Information Theory. In Linear Programming, a constraint
                  is said to be redundant if the feasible decision space is
                  identical with or without the constraint. In Information
                  Theory, redundancy is used as a measure of the stability
                  against noise in transmission. Analogies with Multi Criteria
                  Decision Making (MCDM) are indicated and it is argued that
                  the redundancy concept should be used as a regular feature in
                  conditioning and analysis of Multi Criteria
                  Programs. Properties of a proposed conflict-based
                  characterisation are stated and some existence results are
                  derived. Redundancy is here intended for interactive methods,
                  when the efficient set is progressively explored. A new
                  redundancy test for the linear case is formulated from the
                  framework. A probabilistic method based on correlation is
                  proposed and tested for the non-linear case. Finally, some
                  general guidelines are given concerning the redundancy
                  problem.}

                  researchers have been trying to solve for decades. Many
                  practical scheduling problems such as the hybrid flowshop are
                  NP-hard. As a result, researchers resort to metaheuristics to
                  obtain effective and efficient solutions. The traditional
                  design process of metaheuristics is mainly manual, often
                  metaphor-based, biased by previous experience and prone to
                  producing overly tailored methods that only work well on the
                  tested problems and objectives. In this paper, we use an
                  Automatic Algorithm Design (AAD) methodology to eliminate
                  these limitations. AAD is capable of composing algorithms
                  from components with minimal human intervention. We test the
                  proposed AAD for three different optimization objectives in
                  the hybrid flowshop. Comprehensive computational and
                  statistical testing demonstrates that automatically designed
                  algorithms outperform specifically tailored state-of-the-art
                  methods for the tested objectives in most cases.}

                  two specific types of ERC: one encodes periodic resource
                  availabilities, the other models `commitment' constraints
                  that make the evaluable part of the space a function of
                  earlier evaluations conducted. In an experimental study, both
                  types of constraint are seen to impact the performance of an
                  evolutionary algorithm significantly. To deal with the
                  effects of the ERCs, we propose and test five different
                  constrainthandling policies (adapted from those used to
                  handle `standard' constraints), using a number of different
                  test functions including a fitness landscape from a real
                  closed-loop problem. We show that knowing information about
                  the type of resource constraint in advance may be sufficient
                  to select an effective policy for dealing with it, even when
                  advance knowledge of the fitness landscape is limited.},

                  is still a challenging task, in spite of increasing
                  computational power and faster algorithms. In this
                  paper a new approach combining an ant-based
                  algorithm with an exact solver for (mixed-integer)
                  linear programs is presented. A {MAX-MIN} ant system
                  is developed to determine the principal production
                  decisions, a {LP/MIP} solver is used to calculate
                  the corresponding production quantities and
                  inventory levels. Two different local search methods
                  and an improvement strategy based on reduced
                  mixed-integer problems are developed and integrated
                  into the ant algorithm. This hybrid approach
                  provides superior results for small and medium-sized
                  problems in comparison to the existing approaches in
                  the literature. For large-scale problems the
                  performance of this method is among the best},

                  lines parallel to the x-axis of a Cartesian coordinate
                  system. The objective is to minimize the total communication
                  cost among facilities, while respecting two main conditions:
                  (i) no space is allowed between two adjacent facilities; (ii)
                  the left-most point of the arrangement on either line should
                  have zero abscissa. The conditions (i) and (ii) are required
                  in many applications such as the arrangement of rooms at
                  office buildings or hospitals. The CAP is a NP-Hard
                  problem. In this paper, a mixed-integer programming
                  formulation of the CAP is proposed, which allows us to
                  compute optimal layouts in reasonable time for problem
                  instances of moderate sizes. Moreover, heuristic procedures
                  are presented that can handle larger instances."

                  when an algorithm has to make exploitation-versus-exploration
                  decisions based on uncertain information provided by a random
                  process.  We apply our technique to two models with such an
                  exploitation-exploration trade-off. For the adversarial
                  bandit problem with shifting our new algorithm suffers only
                  $O((ST)^{1/2})$ regret with high probability over $T$ trials
                  with $S$ shifts. Such a regret bound was previously known
                  only in expectation. The second model we consider is
                  associative reinforcement learning with linear value
                  functions. For this model our technique improves the regret
                  from $O(T^{3/4})$ to $O(T^{1/2})$."

                  and logistics costs. To illustrate our theoretical work, we
                  apply the model to a real dataset from the 2015 Nepal

  abstract =     {Consider the following restricted (symmetric or
                  asymmetric) traveling-salesman problem {(TSP):}
                  given an initial ordering of the n cities and an
                  integer $k > 0$, find a minimum-cost
                  feasible tour, where a feasible tour is one in which
                  city $i$ precedes city $j$ whenever $j >= i + k$ in the
                  initial ordering. Balas (1996) has proposed a
                  dynamic-programming algorithm that solves this
                  problem in time linear in n, though exponential in
                  k. Some important real-world problems are amenable
                  to this model or some of its close relatives. The
                  algorithm of Balas (1996) constructs a layered
                  network with a layer of nodes for each position in
                  the tour, such that source-sink paths in this
                  network are in one-to-one correspondence with tours
                  that satisfy the postulated precedence
                  constraints. In this paper we discuss an
                  implementation of the dynamic-programming algorithm
                  for the general case when the integer k is replaced
                  with city-specific integers k(j), j = 1, . . .,
                  n. We discuss applications to, and computational
                  experience with, {TSPs} with time windows, a model
                  frequently used in vehicle routing as well as in
                  scheduling with setup, release and delivery
                  times. We also introduce a new model, the {TSP} with
                  target times, applicable to {Just-in-Time}
                  scheduling problems. Finally for {TSPs} that have no
                  precedence restrictions, we use the algorithm as a
                  heuristic that finds in linear time a local optimum
                  over an exponential-size neighborhood. For this
                  case, we implement an iterated version of our
                  procedure, based on contracting some arcs of the
                  tour produced by a first application of the
                  algorithm, then reapplying the algorithm to the
                  shrunken graph with the same k.},

                  systems, which can be characterized as those systems for

                  accurately predict in detail how the system will behave at

                  well on some best estimate model of the system, cannot be

                  by using ABM requires an alternative approach to decision
                  theory. The general characteristics of such an approach are

                  momentum in disaster management and remain an important but
                  understudied topic in risk governance. Methodologies to
                  conduct a peer review are still in their infancy. To enhance
                  these, a systematic literature review (SLR) of academic and
                  non-academic literature was conducted on city resilience peer
                  reviews. Thirty-three attributes of resilience are
                  identified, which provides useful insights into how research
                  and practice can inform risk governance, and utilise peer
                  reviews, to drive meaningful change. Moreover, it situates
                  the challenges associated with resilience building tools

                  interdisciplinary perspectives for integrated city resilience

                  machine learning to solve combinatorial optimization
                  problems. Given the hard nature of these problems,
                  state-of-the-art algorithms rely on handcrafted heuristics
                  for making decisions that are otherwise too expensive to
                  compute or mathematically not well defined. Thus, machine
                  learning looks like a natural candidate to make such
                  decisions in a more principled and optimized way. We advocate
                  for pushing further the integration of machine learning and
                  combinatorial optimization and detail a methodology to do
                  so. A main point of the paper is seeing generic optimization
                  problems as data points and inquiring what is the relevant
                  distribution of problems to use for learning on a given

  journal =      jmlr,

  volume =       13,
  pages =        {281--305},
  abstract =     {Grid search and manual search are the most widely
                  used strategies for hyper-parameter
                  optimization. This paper shows empirically and
                  theoretically that randomly chosen trials are more
                  efficient for hyper-parameter optimization than
                  trials on a grid. Empirical evidence comes from a
                  comparison with a large previous study that used
                  grid search and manual search to configure neural
                  networks and deep belief networks. Compared with
                  neural networks configured by a pure grid search, we
                  find that random search over the same domain is able
                  to find models that are as good or better within a
                  small fraction of the computation time. Granting
                  random search the same computational budget, random
                  search finds better models by effectively searching
                  a larger, less promising configuration
                  space. Compared with deep belief networks configured
                  by a thoughtful combination of manual search and
                  grid search, purely random search over the same
                  32-dimensional configuration space found
                  statistically equal performance on four of seven
                  data sets, and superior performance on one of
                  seven. A Gaussian process analysis of the function
                  from hyper-parameters to validation set performance
                  reveals that for most data sets only a few of the
                  hyper-parameters really matter, but that different
                  hyper-parameters are important on different data
                  sets. This phenomenon makes grid search a poor
                  choice for configuring algorithms for new data
                  sets. Our analysis casts some light on why recent
                  "High Throughput" methods achieve surprising
                  success: they appear to search through a large number
                  of hyper-parameters because most hyper-parameters do
                  not matter much. We anticipate that growing interest
                  in large hierarchical models will place an
                  increasing burden on techniques for hyper-parameter
                  optimization; this work shows that random search is
                  a natural baseline against which to judge progress
                  in the development of adaptive (sequential)
                  hyper-parameter optimization algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Selecting the right tuning parameters for algorithms is a
                  pravelent problem in machine learning that can significantly
                  affect the performance of algorithms. Data-efficient
                  optimization algorithms, such as Bayesian optimization, have
                  been used to automate this process. During experiments on
                  real-world systems such as robotic platforms these methods
                  can evaluate unsafe parameters that lead to safety-critical
                  system failures and can destroy the system. Recently, a safe
                  Bayesian optimization algorithm, called SafeOpt, has been
                  developed, which guarantees that the performance of the
                  system never falls below a critical value; that is, safety is
                  defined based on the performance function. However, coupling
                  performance and safety is often not desirable in practice,
                  since they are often opposing objectives. In this paper, we
                  present a generalized algorithm that allows for multiple
                  safety constraints separate from the objective. Given an
                  initial set of safe parameters, the algorithm maximizes
                  performance but only evaluates parameters that satisfy safety
                  for all constraints with high probability. To this end, it
                  carefully explores the parameter space by exploiting
                  regularity assumptions in terms of a Gaussian process
                  prior. Moreover, we show how context variables can be used to
                  safely transfer knowledge to new situations and tasks. We
                  provide a theoretical analysis and demonstrate that the
                  proposed algorithm enables fast, automatic, and safe
                  optimization of tuning parameters in experiments on a
                  quadrotor vehicle.}

  abstract =     {The goal of multi-objective optimization is to find
                  a set of best compromise solutions for typically
                  conflicting objectives. Due to the complex nature of
                  most real-life problems, only an approximation to
                  such an optimal set can be obtained within
                  reasonable (computing) time. To compare such
                  approximations, and thereby the performance of
                  multi-objective optimizers providing them, unary
                  quality measures are usually applied. Among these,
                  the \emph{hypervolume indicator} (or
                  \emph{S-metric}) is of particular relevance due to
                  its favorable properties. Moreover, this indicator
                  has been successfully integrated into stochastic
                  optimizers, such as evolutionary algorithms, where
                  it serves as a guidance criterion for finding good
                  approximations to the Pareto front. Recent results
                  show that computing the hypervolume indicator can be
                  seen as solving a specialized version of Klee's
                  Measure Problem.  In general, Klee's Measure Problem
                  can be solved with $\mathcal{O}(n \log n +
                  n^{d/2}\log n)$ comparisons for an input instance of
                  size $n$ in $d$ dimensions; as of this writing, it
                  is unknown whether a lower bound higher than
                  $\Omega(n \log n)$ can be proven. In this article,
                  we derive a lower bound of $\Omega(n\log n)$ for the
                  complexity of computing the hypervolume indicator in
                  any number of dimensions $d>1$ by reducing the
                  so-called \textsc{UniformGap} problem to it.  For
                  the three dimensional case, we also present a
                  matching upper bound of $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$
                  comparisons that is obtained by extending an
                  algorithm for finding the maxima of a point set.},

  abstract =     {Research on multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs)
                  has produced over the past decades a large number of
                  algorithms and a rich literature on performance assessment
                  tools to evaluate and compare them. Yet, newly proposed MOEAs
                  are typically compared against very few, often a decade older
                  MOEAs. One reason for this apparent contradiction is the lack
                  of a common baseline for comparison, with each subsequent
                  study often devising its own experimental scenario, slightly
                  different from other studies. As a result, the state of the
                  art in MOEAs is a disputed topic. This article reports a
                  systematic, comprehensive evaluation of a large number of
                  MOEAs that covers a wide range of experimental scenarios. A
                  novelty of this study is the separation between the
                  higher-level algorithmic components related to
                  multi-objective optimization (MO), which characterize each
                  particular MOEA, and the underlying parameters-such as
                  evolutionary operators, population size, etc.-whose
                  configuration may be tuned for each scenario. Instead of
                  relying on a common or "default" parameter configuration that
                  may be low-performing for particular MOEAs or scenarios and
                  unintentionally biased, we tune the parameters of each MOEA
                  for each scenario using automatic algorithm configuration
                  methods. Our results confirm some of the assumed knowledge in
                  the field, while at the same time they provide new insights
                  on the relative performance of MOEAs for many-objective
                  problems. For example, under certain conditions,
                  indicator-based MOEAs are more competitive for such problems
                  than previously assumed. We also analyze problem-specific
                  features affecting performance, the agreement between
                  performance metrics, and the improvement of tuned
                  configurations over the default configurations used in the
                  literature. Finally, the data produced is made publicly
                  available to motivate further analysis and a baseline for
                  future comparisons.}

                  evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) has helped better identify
                  the current state-of-the-art by considering (i) parameter
                  tuning through automatic configuration, (ii) a wide range of
                  different setups, and (iii) various performance
                  metrics. Here, we automatically devise MOEAs with verified
                  state-of-the-art performance for multi- and many-objective
                  continuous optimization. Our work is based on two main
                  considerations. The first is that high-performing algorithms
                  can be obtained from a configurable algorithmic framework in
                  an automated way. The second is that multiple performance
                  metrics may be required to guide this automatic design
                  process. In the first part of this work, we extend our
                  previously proposed algorithmic framework, increasing the
                  number of MOEAs, underlying evolutionary algorithms, and
                  search paradigms that it comprises. These components can be
                  combined following a general MOEA template, and an automatic
                  configuration method is used to instantiate high-performing
                  MOEA designs that optimize a given performance metric and
                  present state-of-the-art performance. In the second part, we
                  propose a multiobjective formulation for the automatic MOEA
                  design, which proves critical for the context of
                  many-objective optimization due to the disagreement of
                  established performance metrics. Our proposed formulation
                  leads to an automatically designed MOEA that presents
                  state-of-the-art performance according to a set of metrics,
                  rather than a single one."

                  Pareto-optimal solutions. Recovering Pareto fronts or Pareto
                  sets from a limited number of function evaluations are
                  challenging problems. A popular approach in the case of
                  expensive-to-evaluate functions is to appeal to
                  metamodels. Kriging has been shown efficient as a base for
                  sequential multi-objective optimization, notably through
                  infill sampling criteria balancing exploitation and
                  exploration such as the Expected Hypervolume
                  Improvement. Here we consider Kriging metamodels not only for
                  selecting new points, but as a tool for estimating the whole
                  Pareto front and quantifying how much uncertainty remains on
                  it at any stage of Kriging-based multi-objective optimization

                  as SNOPT, IPOPT, GSL and NLopt), PaGMO is at its core a C++
                  library which employs an object-oriented architecture
                  providing a clean and easily-extensible optimisation
                  framework. Adoption of multi-threaded programming ensures the
                  efficient exploitation of modern multi-core architectures and
                  allows for a straightforward implementation of the island
                  model paradigm, in which multiple populations of candidate
                  solutions asynchronously exchange information in order to
                  speed-up and improve the optimisation process. In addition to
                  the C++ interface, PaGMO's capabilities are exposed to the
                  high-level language Python, so that it is possible to easily
                  use PaGMO in an interactive session and take advantage of the
                  numerous scientific Python libraries available.}

  abstract     = {This paper reports on the first international competition on
                  AI for the traveling salesman problem (TSP) at the
                  International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence
                  2021 (IJCAI-21). The TSP is one of the classical
                  combinatorial optimization problems, with many variants
                  inspired by real-world applications. This first competition
                  asked the participants to develop algorithms to solve an
                  orienteering problem with stochastic weights and time windows
                  (OPSWTW). It focused on two learning approaches:
                  surrogate-based optimization and deep reinforcement
                  learning. In this paper, we describe the problem, the
                  competition setup, and the winning methods, and give an
                  overview of the results. The winning methods described in
                  this work have advanced the state-of-the-art in using AI for
                  stochastic routing problems. Overall, by organizing this
                  competition we have introduced routing problems as an
                  interesting problem setting for AI researchers. The simulator
                  of the problem has been made open-source and can be used by
                  other researchers as a benchmark for new learning-based
                  methods. The instances and code for the competition are
                  available at

                  assess the current state of the art and guide future research
                  and development. AI planning is no exception, and the
                  International Planning Competition (IPC) has been frequently
                  run for nearly two decades. Due to the organisational and
                  computational burden involved in running these competitions,
                  solvers are generally compared using a single homogeneous
                  hardware and software environment for all competitors. To
                  what extent does the specific choice of hardware and software
                  environment have an effect on solver performance, and is that
                  effect distributed equally across the competing solvers? In
                  this work, we use the competing planners and benchmark
                  instance sets from the 2014 IPC to investigate these two
                  questions. We recreate the 2014 IPC Optimal and Agile tracks
                  on two distinct hardware environments and eight distinct
                  software environments. We show that solver performance varies
                  significantly based on the hardware and software environment,
                  and that this variation is not equal for all
                  planners. Furthermore, the observed variation is sufficient
                  to change the competition rankings, including the top-ranked

                  conventional {SA} search scheme is replaced by a new
                  design that takes into account the specificity of
                  the solution space of project scheduling
                  problems. For {RCPSP}, the search was based on an
                  alternated activity and time incrementing process,
                  and all parameters were set after preliminary
                  statistical experiments done on test instances. For
                  {MRCPSP}, we introduced an original approach using
                  two embedded search loops alternating activity and
                  mode neighbourhood exploration. The performance
                  evaluation done on the benchmark instances available
                  in the literature proved the efficiency of both
                  adaptations that are currently among the most
                  competitive algorithms for these problems.},

                  such that each box has a corner at the origin and the other
                  corner in the positive quadrant of $\mathbb{R}^d$, and let
                  $k$ be a positive integer.  We study the problem of selecting
                  $k$ boxes in $B$ that maximize the volume of the union of the
                  selected boxes.  This research is motivated by applications
                  in skyline queries for databases and in multicriteria
                  optimization, where the problem is known as the
                  \emph{hypervolume subset selection problem}.  It is known
                  that the problem can be solved in polynomial time in the

                  problem is NP-hard already in 3 dimensions. In 3 dimensions,
                  we break the bound $\Omega\big(\binom{n}{k}\big)$, by
                  providing an $n^{O(\sqrt{k})}$ algorithm. For any constant

  abstract =     {Recently, there has been a large interest in set-based
                  evolutionary algorithms for multi objective
                  optimization. They are based on the definition of indicators
                  that characterize the quality of the current population while
                  being compliant with the concept of Pareto-optimality. It has
                  been shown that the hypervolume indicator, which measures the
                  dominated volume in the objective space, enables the design
                  of efficient search algorithms and, at the same time, opens
                  up opportunities to express user preferences in the search by
                  means of weight functions. The present paper contains the
                  necessary theoretical foundations and corresponding
                  algorithms to (i) select appropriate weight functions, to
                  (ii) transform user preferences into weight functions and to
                  (iii) efficiently evaluate the weighted hypervolume indicator
                  through Monte Carlo sampling. The algorithm W-HypE, which
                  implements the previous concepts, is introduced, and the
                  effectiveness of the search, directed towards the user's
                  preferred solutions, is shown using an extensive set of
                  experiments including the necessary statistical performance

                  search efficiency, computational cost, decision making,
                  visualization, and so on. This leads to various research
                  questions, in particular whether certain objectives can be
                  omitted in order to overcome or at least diminish the
                  difficulties that arise when many, that is, more than three,
                  objective functions are involved. This study addresses this
                  question from different perspectives. First, we investigate
                  how adding or omitting objectives affects the problem
                  characteristics and propose a general notion of conflict
                  between objective sets as a theoretical foundation for
                  objective reduction. Second, we present both exact and
                  heuristic algorithms to systematically reduce the number of
                  objectives, while preserving as much as possible of the
                  dominance structure of the underlying optimization
                  problem. Third, we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed
                  objective reduction method in the context of both decision
                  making and search for a radar waveform application as well as
                  for well-known test functions.",

  title =        {A distance-based ranking model estimation of distribution
                  algorithm for the flowshop scheduling problem},
  abstract =     {The aim of this paper is two-fold. First, we introduce a
                  novel general estimation of distribution algorithm to deal
                  with permutation-based optimization problems. The algorithm
                  is based on the use of a probabilistic model for permutations
                  called the generalized Mallows model. In order to prove the
                  potential of the proposed algorithm, our second aim is to
                  solve the permutation flowshop scheduling problem. A hybrid
                  approach consisting of the new estimation of distribution
                  algorithm and a variable neighborhood search is
                  proposed. Conducted experiments demonstrate that the proposed
                  algorithm is able to outperform the state-of-the-art
                  approaches. Moreover, from the 220 benchmark instances
                  tested, the proposed hybrid approach obtains new best known
                  results in 152 cases. An in-depth study of the results
                  suggests that the successful performance of the introduced
                  approach is due to the ability of the generalized Mallows
                  estimation of distribution algorithm to discover promising
                  regions in the search space.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we consider the problem of finding the
                  efficient frontier associated with the standard mean-variance
                  portfolio optimisation model. We extend the standard model to
                  include cardinality constraints that limit a portfolio to
                  have a specified number of assets, and to impose limits on
                  the proportion of the portfolio held in a given asset (if any
                  of the asset is held). We illustrate the differences that
                  arise in the shape of this efficient frontier when such
                  constraints are present. We present three heuristic
                  algorithms based upon genetic algorithms, tabu search and
                  simulated annealing for finding the cardinality constrained
                  efficient frontier. Computational results are presented for
                  five data sets involving up to 225 assets.  Scope and purpose
                  The standard Markowitz mean-variance approach to portfolio
                  selection involves tracing out an efficient frontier, a
                  continuous curve illustrating the tradeoff between return and
                  risk (variance). This frontier can be easily found via
                  quadratic programming. This approach is well-known and widely
                  applied. However, for practical purposes, it may be desirable
                  to limit the number of assets in a portfolio, as well as
                  imposing limits on the proportion of the portfolio devoted to
                  any particular asset. If such constraints exist, the problem
                  of finding the efficient frontier becomes much harder. This
                  paper illustrates how, in the presence of such constraints,
                  the efficient frontier becomes discontinuous. Three heuristic
                  techniques are applied to the problem of finding this
                  efficient frontier and computational results presented for a
                  number of data sets which are made publicly available.}

                  multiobjective optimization problems but are often criticized
                  because of a large number of function evaluations
                  needed. Approximations, especially function approximations,
                  also referred to as surrogates or metamodels are commonly
                  used in the literature to reduce the computation time. This
                  paper presents a survey of 45 different recent algorithms
                  proposed in the literature between 2008 and 2016 to handle
                  computationally expensive multiobjective optimization
                  problems. Several algorithms are discussed based on what kind
                  of an approximation such as problem, function or fitness
                  approximation they use. Most emphasis is given to function
                  approximation-based algorithms. We also compare these
                  algorithms based on different criteria such as metamodeling
                  technique and evolutionary algorithm used, type and
                  dimensions of the problem solved, handling constraints,
                  training time and the type of evolution control. Furthermore,
                  we identify and discuss some promising elements and major
                  issues among algorithms in the literature related to using an
                  approximation and numerical settings used. In addition, we
                  discuss selecting an algorithm to solve a given
                  computationally expensive multiobjective optimization problem
                  based on the dimensions in both objective and decision spaces

                  candidate solutions requires the simulation of a process
                  under various (traffic) scenarios. Thus, good solutions
                  should not only achieve good objective function values, but
                  they must be robust (low variance) across all different
                  scenarios. Previous work has shown that combining IRACE with
                  evolutionary operators is effective for this task due to the
                  power of evolutionary operators in numerical optimization. In
                  this paper, we further explore the hybridization of
                  evolutionary operators and the elitist iterated racing of
                  IRACE for the simulation-optimization of traffic light
                  programs. We review previous works from the literature to
                  find the evolutionary operators performing the best when
                  facing this problem to propose new hybrid algorithms. We
                  evaluate our approach over a realistic case study derived
                  from the traffic network of Málaga (Spain) with 275 traffic
                  lights that should be scheduled optimally. The experimental
                  analysis reveals that the hybrid algorithm comprising IRACE
                  plus differential evolution offers statistically better
                  results than the other algorithms when the budget of
                  simulations is low. In contrast, IRACE performs better than
                  the hybrids for high simulations budget, although the
                  optimization time is much longer.},

  abstract =     {Solutions to most practical numerical optimization problems
                  must be evaluated for their performance over a number of
                  different loading or operating conditions, which we refer
                  here as scenarios. Therefore, a meaningful and resilient
                  optimal solution must be such that it remains feasible under
                  all scenarios and performs close to an individual optimal
                  solution corresponding to each scenario. Despite its
                  practical importance, multi-scenario consideration has
                  received a lukewarm attention, particularly in the context of
                  multi-objective optimization. The usual practice is to
                  optimize for the worst-case scenario. In this paper, we
                  review existing methodologies in this direction and set our
                  goal to suggest a new and potential population-based method
                  for handling multiple scenarios by defining scenario-wise
                  domination principle and scenario-wise diversity-preserving
                  operators. To evaluate, the proposed method is applied to a
                  number of numerical test problems and engineering design
                  problems with a detail explanation of the obtained results
                  and compared with an existing method. This first systematic
                  evolutionary based multi-scenario, multiobjective,
                  optimization study on numerical problems indicates that
                  multiple scenarios can be handled in an integrated manner
                  using an EMO framework to find a well-balanced compromise set
                  of solutions to multiple scenarios and maintain a tradeoff
                  among multiple objectives. In comparison to an existing
                  serial multiple optimization approach, the proposed approach
                  finds a set of compromised trade-off solutions
                  simultaneously. An achievement of multi-objective trade-off
                  and multi-scenario trade-off is algorithmically challenging,
                  but due to its practical appeal, further research and
                  application must be spent.},

                  tune and design optimisation algorithms for problems with
                  multiple objectives. Most AC methods use unary quality
                  indicators, which assign a single scalar value to an
                  approximation to the Pareto front, to compare the performance
                  of different optimisers. These quality indicators, however,
                  imply preferences beyond Pareto-optimality that may differ
                  from those of the decision maker (DM). Although it is
                  possible to incorporate DM's preferences into quality
                  indicators, e.g., by means of the weighted hypervolume
                  indicator (HV$^w$), expressing preferences in terms of weight
                  function is not always intuitive nor an easy task for a DM,
                  in particular, when comparing the stochastic outcomes of
                  several algorithm configurations. A more visual approach to
                  compare such outcomes is the visualisation of their empirical
                  attainment functions (EAFs) differences. This paper proposes
                  using such visualisations as a way of eliciting information
                  about regions of the objective space that are preferred by
                  the DM. We present a method to convert the information about
                  EAF differences into a HV$^w$ that will assign higher quality
                  values to approximation fronts that result in EAF differences
                  preferred by the DM. We show that the resulting HV$^w$ may be
                  used by an AC method to guide the configuration of
                  multi-objective optimisers according to the preferences of
                  the DM. We evaluate the proposed approach on a well-known
                  benchmark problem. Finally, we apply our approach to
                  re-configuring, according to different DM's preferences, a
                  multi-objective optimiser tackling a real-world production
                  planning problem arising in the manufacturing industry.",

                  model, in the sense that every choice probability
                  distribution generated by the former can also be explained by
                  the latter. Our proof relies on the construction of a
                  probabilistic ranking model which we label the ``repeated
                  insertion model''. This model is a special case of Marden's
                  orthogonal contrast model class and, in turn, includes the
                  classical Mallows $\varphi$-model as a special case. We
                  explore its basic properties as well as its relationship to
                  Fligner and Verducci's multistage ranking model."

                  time-consuming problem in control. This is especially true in
                  the field of adaptive control, where good performance is
                  typically only achieved after significant tuning. Recently,
                  it has been shown that constrained Bayesian optimization is a
                  promising approach to automate the tuning process without
                  risking system failures during the optimization
                  process. However, this approach is computationally too
                  expensive for tuning more than a couple of parameters. In
                  this paper, we provide a heuristic in order to efficiently
                  perform constrained Bayesian optimization in high-dimensional
                  parameter spaces by using an adaptive discretization based on
                  particle swarms. We apply the method to the tuning problem of
                  an L1 adaptive controller on a quadrotor vehicle and show
                  that we can reliably and automatically tune parameters in
                  experiments."

                  citations might distort science are frequently discussed, but
                  have not been verified directly. Of the hypothesized
                  problems, perhaps the most worrying is a worsening of
                  positive-outcome bias. A system that disfavours negative
                  results not only distorts the scientific literature directly,
                  but might also discourage high-risk projects and pressure
                  scientists to fabricate and falsify their data. This study
                  analysed over 4,600 papers published in all disciplines
                  between 1990 and 2007, measuring the frequency of papers
                  that, having declared to have ``tested'' a hypothesis,
                  reported a positive support for it. The overall frequency of
                  positive supports has grown by over 22{\%} between 1990 and
                  2007, with significant differences between disciplines and
                  countries. The increase was stronger in the social and some
                  biomedical disciplines. The United States had published, over
                  the years, significantly fewer positive results than Asian
                  countries (and particularly Japan) but more than European
                  countries (and in particular the United
                  Kingdom). Methodological artefacts cannot explain away these
                  patterns, which support the hypotheses that research is
                  becoming less pioneering and/or that the objectivity with
                  which results are produced and published is decreasing.",

  abstract =     { High sensitivity to initial conditions is generally viewed
                  as a drawback of tree search methods because it leads to
                  erratic behavior to be mitigated somehow. In this paper we
                  investigate the opposite viewpoint and consider this behavior
                  as an opportunity to exploit. Our working hypothesis is that
                  erraticism is in fact just a consequence of the exponential
                  nature of tree search that acts as a chaotic amplifier, so it
                  is largely unavoidable. We propose a bet-and-run approach to
                  actually turn erraticism to one's advantage. The idea is to
                  make a number of short sample runs with randomized initial
                  conditions, to bet on the "most promising" run selected
                  according to certain simple criteria, and to bring it to
                  completion. Computational results on a large testbed of mixed
                  integer linear programs from the literature are presented,
                  showing the potential of this approach even when embedded in
                  a proof-of-concept implementation. }

                  multi-objective optimization that uses a partial preference
                  order to act as the fitness function in a customized genetic
                  algorithm. We periodically send solutions to the decision
                  maker (DM) for her evaluation and use the resulting
                  preference information to form preference cones consisting of
                  inferior solutions. The cones allow us to implicitly rank
                  solutions that the DM has not considered. This technique
                  avoids assuming an exact form for the preference function,
                  but does assume that the preference function is
                  quasi-concave. This paper describes the genetic algorithm and
                  demonstrates its performance on the multi-objective knapsack

                  algorithms such as local search for a difficult
                  problem such as satisfiability testing ({SAT)} is a
                  challenging task. We investigate an evolutionary
                  approach to automating the discovery of new local
                  search heuristics for {SAT}. We show that several
                  well-known {SAT} local search algorithms such as
                  Walksat and Novelty are composite heuristics that
                  are derived from novel combinations of a set of
                  building blocks. Based on this observation, we
                  developed {CLASS}, a genetic programming system that
                  uses a simple composition operator to automatically
                  discover {SAT} local search heuristics. New
                  heuristics discovered by {CLASS} are shown to be
                  competitive with the best Walksat variants,
                  including Novelty+. Evolutionary algorithms have
                  previously been applied to directly evolve a
                  solution for a particular {SAT} instance. We show
                  that the heuristics discovered by {CLASS} are also
                  competitive with these previous, direct evolutionary
                  approaches for {SAT}. We also analyze the local
                  search behavior of the learned heuristics using the
                  depth, mobility, and coverage metrics proposed by
                  Schuurmans and Southey.},

                  solutions. Such objectives are said to be
                  redundant. Introducing systems of objective functions which
                  realize their individual optimum in a single vertex of the
                  polyhedron generated by the restriction set, the notion of
                  relative or absolute redundant objectives is defined. A
                  theory which describes properties of absolute and relative
                  redundant objectives is developed. A method for determining
                  all the relative and absolute redundant objectives, based on
                  this theory, is given. Illustrative examples demonstrate the
                  procedure.}

  abstract =     {After growing up together, and mostly growing apart in the
                  second half of the 20th century, the fields of artificial
                  intelligence (AI), cognitive science, and neuroscience are
                  reconverging on a shared view of the computational
                  foundations of intelligence that promotes valuable
                  cross-disciplinary exchanges on questions, methods, and
                  results. We chart advances over the past several decades that
                  address challenges of perception and action under uncertainty
                  through the lens of computation. Advances include the
                  development of representations and inferential procedures for
                  large-scale probabilistic inference and machinery for
                  enabling reflection and decisions about tradeoffs in effort,
                  precision, and timeliness of computations. These tools are
                  deployed toward the goal of computational rationality:
                  identifying decisions with highest expected utility, while
                  taking into consideration the costs of computation in complex
                  real-world problems in which most relevant calculations can
                  only be approximated. We highlight key concepts with examples
                  that show the potential for interchange between computer
                  science, cognitive science, and neuroscience.},

  abstract =     {Intuitionistic fuzzy sets describe information from the three
                  aspects of membership degree, non-membership degree and
                  hesitation degree, which has more practical significance when
                  uncertainty pervades qualitative decision problems. In this
                  paper, we investigate the problem of ranking intuitionistic
                  fuzzy preference relations (IFPRs) based on various
                  non-linear utility functions. First, we transform IFPRs into
                  their isomorphic interval-value fuzzy preference relations
                  (IVFPRs), and utilise non-linear utility functions, such as
                  parabolic, S-shaped, and hyperbolic absolute risk aversion,
                  to fit the true value of a decision-maker's
                  judgement. Ultimately, the optimization ordering models for
                  the membership and non-membership of IVFPRs based on utility
                  function are constructed, with objective function aiming at
                  minimizing the distance deviation between the multiplicative
                  consistency ideal judgment and the actual judgment,
                  represented by utility function, subject to the
                  decision-maker's utility constraints. The proposed models
                  ensure that more factual and optimal ranking of alternative
                  is acquired, avoiding information distortion caused by the
                  operations of intervals. Second, by introducing a
                  non-Archimedean infinitesimal, we establish the optimization
                  ordering model for IFPRs with the priority of utility or
                  deviation, which realises the goal of prioritising solutions
                  under multi-objective programming. Subsequently, we verify
                  that a close connection exists between the ranking for
                  membership and non-membership degree IVFPRs. Comparison
                  analyses with existing approaches are summarized to
                  demonstrate that the proposed models have advantage in
                  dealing with group decision making problems with IFPRs.}

                  technique in sustainability analysis, as it can assist in the
                  study of optimal trade-off solutions that balance several
                  criteria. The main limitation of multi-objective optimization
                  is that its computational burden grows in size with the
                  number of objectives. This computational barrier is critical
                  in environmental applications in which decision-makers seek
                  to minimize simultaneously several environmental indicators
                  of concern. With the aim to overcome this limitation, this
                  paper introduces a systematic method for reducing the number
                  of objectives in multi-objective optimization with emphasis
                  on environmental problems. The approach presented relies on a
                  novel mixed-integer linear programming formulation that
                  minimizes the error of omitting objectives. We test the
                  capabilities of this technique through two environmental
                  problems of different nature in which we attempt to minimize
                  a set of life cycle assessment impacts. Numerical examples
                  demonstrate that certain environmental metrics tend to behave
                  in a non-conflicting manner, which makes it possible to
                  reduce the dimension of the problem without losing
                  information.}

                  currently under discussion at the Vienna hospital

                  following days to public hospitals while taking into account
                  a variety of soft and hard constraints regarding working date
                  and time, working patterns, nurses qualifications, nurses
                  and hospitals preferences, as well as costs. Extensive
                  computational experiments based on a four week simulation
                  period were used to evaluate three different scenarios
                  varying the number of nurses and hospitals for six different
                  hospitals demand intensities. The results of our simulations

                  accumulation. We show that one gets completely opposite
                  results depending on the way the phenomenon is described and
                  how the questions are phrased and graphs used. The results
                  suggest that OR processes are highly sensitive to various
                  behavioral effects. As a result, we need to pay attention to
                  the way we communicate about models as they are being
                  increasingly used in addressing important problems like
                  climate change.},

                  to determine the sequence of tasks to satisfy the demand of
                  customers who order several types of products produced on a
                  single machine. A setup is required whenever a product type
                  is launched.  The objective of the scheduling problem is to
                  minimize the average customer order flow time. Since the
                  customer order scheduling problem is known to be strongly
                  {NP-hard,} we solve it using four major metaheuristics and
                  compare the performance of these heuristics, namely,
                  simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, tabu search, and ant
                  colony optimization. These are selected to represent various
                  characteristics of metaheuristics: nature-inspired
                  vs. artificially created, population-based vs. local search,
                  etc. A set of problems is generated to compare the solution
                  quality and computational efforts of these heuristics.
                  Results of the experimentation show that tabu search and ant
                  colony perform better for large problems whereas simulated
                  annealing performs best in small-size problems. Some
                  conclusions are also drawn on the interactions between
                  various problem parameters and the performance of the
                  heuristics.},

                  used to acquire difficult to solve combinatorial problem
                  instances. As a result of this technique, the corresponding
                  algorithms used to solve these instances are
                  stress-tested. The technique is applied in three important
                  domains of combinatorial optimisation, binary constraint
                  satisfaction, Boolean satisfiability, and the travelling
                  salesman problem. The problem instances acquired through this
                  technique are more difficult than the ones found in popular
                  benchmarks. In this paper, these evolved instances are
                  analysed with the aim to explain their difficulty in terms of
                  structural properties, thereby exposing the weaknesses of
                  corresponding algorithms. }

  abstract     = {Perhaps surprisingly, it is possible to predict how long an
                  algorithm will take to run on a previously unseen input,
                  using machine learning techniques to build a model of the
                  algorithm's runtime as a function of problem-specific
                  instance features. Such models have important applications to
                  algorithm analysis, portfolio-based algorithm selection, and
                  the automatic configuration of parameterized algorithms. Over
                  the past decade, a wide variety of techniques have been
                  studied for building such models. Here, we describe
                  extensions and improvements of existing models, new families
                  of models, and---perhaps most importantly---a much more thorough
                  treatment of algorithm parameters as model inputs. We also
                  comprehensively describe new and existing features for
                  predicting algorithm runtime for propositional satisfiability
                  (SAT), travelling salesperson (TSP) and mixed integer
                  programming (MIP) problems. We evaluate these innovations
                  through the largest empirical analysis of its kind, comparing
                  to a wide range of runtime modelling techniques from the
                  literature. Our experiments consider 11 algorithms and 35
                  instance distributions; they also span a very wide range of
                  SAT, MIP, and TSP instances, with the least structured having
                  been generated uniformly at random and the most structured
                  having emerged from real industrial applications. Overall, we
                  demonstrate that our new models yield substantially better
                  runtime predictions than previous approaches in terms of
                  their generalization to new problem instances, to new
                  algorithms from a parameterized space, and to both
                  simultaneously.},

  abstract =     "This paper deals with minimizing the total cost of
                  pumping in a liquid pipeline. Previous experience
                  with the most common solution procedures in pipeline
                  optimization is discussed along with their strengths
                  and weaknesses. The proposed method is an
                  evolutionary algorithm with two distinct features:
                  (1) The search is restricted to feasible region
                  only; and (2) it utilizes a floating point decision
                  variable rather than integer or binary as is the
                  case with most other similar approaches. A numerical
                  example is presented as a basis for verification of
                  the proposed method and its comparison with the
                  existing solver that utilizes the nonlinear
                  Newtonian search. The proposed method provides
                  promising improvements in terms of optimality when
                  compared to the widespread gradient search methods
                  because it does not involve evaluation of the
                  gradient of the objective function. It also provides
                  potential to improve the performance of previous
                  evolutionary programs because it restricts the
                  search to the feasible region, thus eliminating
                  large overhead associated with generation and
                  inspection of solutions that are
                  infeasible. Comparison of the two solutions revealed
                  improvement of the solution in favor of the proposed
                  algorithm, which ranged up to 6\% depending on the
                  initial values of the decision variables in the
                  Newtonian search. The proposed method was not
                  sensitive to the starting value of the decision
                  variables.",

                  provides estimates of a set of uncertain quantities. Subjects
                  in the anchored condition first judge whether a specified
                  number (the anchor) is higher or lower than the true value
                  before estimating each quantity. The anchors are set at
                  predetermined percentiles of the distribution of estimates in
                  the calibration group (15th and 85th percentiles in this
                  study). This procedure permits the transformation of anchored
                  estimates into percentiles in the calibration group, allows
                  pooling of results across problems, and provides a natural
                  measure of the size of the effect. The authors illustrate the
                  method by a demonstration that the initial judgment of the
                  anchor is susceptible to an anchoring-like bias and by an
                  analysis of the relation between anchoring and subjective

                  computation uses efficient computational models, often known
                  as surrogates or meta-models, for approximating the fitness
                  function in evolutionary algorithms. Research on
                  surrogate-assisted evolutionary computation began over a
                  decade ago and has received considerably increasing interest
                  in recent years. Very interestingly, surrogate-assisted
                  evolutionary computation has found successful applications
                  not only in solving computationally expensive single- or
                  multi-objective optimization problems, but also in addressing
                  dynamic optimization problems, constrained optimization
                  problems and multi-modal optimization problems. This paper
                  provides a concise overview of the history and recent
                  developments in surrogate-assisted evolutionary computation
                  and suggests a few future trends in this research area.},

                  linear programming for determining an optimal
                  (minimum cost) schedule of pumping on a 24-hr
                  basis. Both unit and maximum demand electricity
                  charges are considered. Account is taken of the
                  relative efficiencies of the available pumps, the
                  structure of the electricity tariff, the
                  consumer-demand profile, and the hydraulic
                  characteristics and operational constraints of the

                  the network operation in determining the parameters

                  and in studying the optimized network operation is
                  described. An application of the method to an
                  existing network in the United Kingdom is presented,
                  showing that considerable savings are possible. The
                  method was found to be robust and with low
                  computation-time requirements, and is therefore

                  problems. This integration aims to lead meta-heuristics
                  toward an efficient, effective, and robust search and improve
                  their performance in terms of solution quality, convergence
                  rate, and robustness. Since various integration methods with
                  different purposes have been developed, there is a need to
                  review the recent advances in using machine learning
                  techniques to improve meta-heuristics. To the best of our
                  knowledge, the literature is deprived of having a
                  comprehensive yet technical review. To fill this gap, this
                  paper provides such a review on the use of machine learning
                  techniques in the design of different elements of
                  meta-heuristics for different purposes including algorithm
                  selection, fitness evaluation, initialization, evolution,
                  parameter setting, and cooperation. First, we describe the
                  key concepts and preliminaries of each of these ways of
                  integration. Then, the recent advances in each way of
                  integration are reviewed and classified based on a proposed
                  unified taxonomy. Finally, we provide a technical discussion
                  on the advantages, limitations, requirements, and challenges
                  of implementing each of these integration ways, followed by
                  promising future research directions.}

  abstract =     {The team orienteering problem {(TOP)} involves
                  finding a set of paths from the starting point to
                  the ending point such that the total collected
                  reward received from visiting a subset of locations
                  is maximized and the length of each path is
                  restricted by a pre-specified limit. In this paper,
                  an ant colony optimization {(ACO)} approach is
                  proposed for the team orienteering problem. Four
                  methods, i.e., the sequential,
                  deterministic-concurrent and random-concurrent and
                  simultaneous methods, are proposed to construct
                  candidate solutions in the framework of {ACO}. We
                  compare these methods according to the results
                  obtained on well-known problems from the
                  literature. Finally, we compare the algorithm with
                  several existing algorithms. The results show that
                  our algorithm is promising.},

                  their effectiveness in automatically constructing algorithm
                  selection models in continuous black-box optimization
                  problems. Focusing on algorithm performance results of the
                  COCO platform of several years, we construct a representative
                  set of high-performing complementary solvers and present an
                  algorithm selection model that, compared to the portfolio's
                  single best solver, on average requires less than half of the
                  resources for solving a given problem. Therefore, there is a
                  huge gain in efficiency compared to classical ensemble
                  methods combined with an increased insight into problem
                  characteristics and algorithm properties by using informative
                  features. The model acts on the assumption that the function
                  set of the Black-Box Optimization Benchmark is representative
                  enough for practical applications. The model allows for
                  selecting the best suited optimization algorithm within the
                  considered set for unseen problems prior to the optimization
                  itself based on a small sample of function evaluations. Note
                  that such a sample can even be reused for the initial
                  population of an evolutionary (optimization) algorithm so
                  that even the feature costs become negligible. }

                  (e.g., breakage of a machine or equipment, or life

                  reinforcement learning algorithms was published in 2015, a
                  number of new algorithms have been proposed thereafter, and

                  of domains including reinforcement learning, Gaussian process
                  regression and classification, evolutionary algorithms, and
                  active learning. We provide the fundamental concepts on which

  abstract =     {We propose a practical Bayesian optimization method over
                  sets, to minimize a black-box function that takes a set as a
                  single input. Because set inputs are permutation-invariant,
                  traditional Gaussian process-based Bayesian optimization
                  strategies which assume vector inputs can fall short. To
                  address this, we develop a Bayesian optimization method with
                  \emph{set kernel} that is used to build surrogate
                  functions. This kernel accumulates similarity over set
                  elements to enforce permutation-invariance, but this comes at
                  a greater computational cost. To reduce this burden, we
                  propose two key components: (i) a more efficient approximate
                  set kernel which is still positive-definite and is an
                  unbiased estimator of the true set kernel with upper-bounded
                  variance in terms of the number of subsamples, (ii) a
                  constrained acquisition function optimization over sets,
                  which uses symmetry of the feasible region that defines a set
                  input. Finally, we present several numerical experiments
                  which demonstrate that our method outperforms other methods.},

    abstract = {Artificial evolution has been used for more than 50 years as a method of optimization in engineering, operations research and computational intelligence. In closed-loop evolution (a term used by the statistician, George Box) or, equivalently, evolutionary experimentation (Ingo Rechenberg's terminology), the ``phenotypes'' are evaluated in the real world by conducting a physical experiment, whilst selection and breeding is simulated. Well-known early work on artificial evolution\textemdash design engineering problems in fluid dynamics, and chemical plant process optimization\textemdash was carried out in this experimental mode. More recently, the closed-loop approach has been successfully used in much evolvable hardware and evolutionary robotics research, and in some microbiology and biochemistry applications. In this article, several further new targets for closed-loop evolutionary and multiobjective optimization are considered. Four case studies from my own collaborative work are described: (i) instrument optimization in analytical biochemistry; (ii) finding effective drug combinations in vitro; (iii) onchip synthetic biomolecule design; and (iv) improving chocolate production processes. Accurate simulation in these applications is not possible due to complexity or a lack of adequate analytical models. In these and other applications discussed, optimizing experimentally brings with it several challenges: noise; nuisance factors; ephemeral resource constraints; expensive evaluations, and evaluations that must be done in (large) batches. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are largely equal to these vagaries, whilst modern multiobjective EAs also enable tradeoffs among conflicting optimization goals to be explored. Nevertheless, principles from other disciplines, such as statistics, Design of Experiments, machine learning and global optimization are also relevant to aspects of the closed-loop problem, and may inspire futher development of multiobjective EAs.},

                  large number of heuristics that have recently been
                  proposed in the literature. Most of these heuristics
                  are then evaluated in a computational study and
                  compared on the basis of our standardized
                  experimental design. Based on the computational
                  results we discuss features of good heuristics. The
                  paper closes with some remarks on our test design
                  and a summary of the recent developments in research

                  important in many settings, including spatial databases (Find
                  the k closest cities) and multimedia databases (Find the k
                  most similar images). Previous analyses have concluded that
                  nearest-neighbor search is hopeless in high dimensions due to
                  the notorious "curse of dimensionality". We show that this
                  may be overpessimistic. We show that what determines the
                  search performance (at least for R-tree-like structures) is
                  the intrinsic dimensionality of the data set and not the
                  dimensionality of the address space (referred to as the
                  embedding dimensionality). The typical (and often implicit)
                  assumption in many previous studies is that the data is
                  uniformly distributed, with independence between
                  attributes. However, real data sets overwhelmingly disobey
                  these assumptions; rather, they typically are skewed and
                  exhibit intrinsic ("fractal") dimensionalities that are much
                  lower than their embedding dimension, e.g. due to subtle
                  dependencies between attributes. We show how the Hausdorff
                  and Correlation fractal dimensions of a data set can yield
                  extremely accurate formulas that can predict the I/O
                  performance to within one standard deviation on multiple real
                  and synthetic data sets.}

                  ant colony optimization, are widely used for different
                  combinatorial optimization problems. These algorithms rely
                  heavily on the use of randomness and are hard to understand

                  the theoretical analysis of ant colony optimization and
                  studies this type of algorithm on one of the most prominent
                  combinatorial optimization problems, namely the traveling

  abstract =     {Application of heuristic solution procedures to the
                  practical problem of project scheduling has
                  previously been studied by numerous
                  researchers. However, there is little consensus
                  about their findings, and the practicing manager is
                  currently at a loss as to which scheduling rule to
                  use. Furthermore, since no categorization process
                  was developed, it is assumed that once a rule is
                  selected it must be used throughout the whole
                  project. This research breaks away from this
                  tradition by providing a categorization process
                  based on two powerful project summary measures. The
                  first measure identifies the location of the peak of
                  total resource requirements and the second measure
                  identifies the rate of utilization of each resource
                  type. The performance of the rules are classified
                  according to values of these two measures, and it is
                  shown that a rule introduced by this research
                  performs significantly better on most categories of
                  projects.},

                  space is presented. Theoretical and experimental results
                  illustrate the usefulness of the method for such problems as
                  the experimental optimization of the performance of a system
                  with a very general multipeak performance function when the
                  only available information is noise-distributed samples of
                  the function. At present, its usefulness is restricted to
                  optimization with respect to one system parameter. The
                  observations are taken sequentially; but, as opposed to the
                  gradient method, the observation may be located anywhere on
                  the parameter interval. A sequence of estimates of the
                  location of the curve maximum is generated. The location of
                  the next observation may be interpreted as the location of
                  the most likely competitor (with the current best estimate)
                  for the location of the curve maximum. A Brownian motion
                  stochastic process is selected as a model for the unknown
                  function, and the observations are interpreted with respect
                  to the model. The model gives the results a simple intuitive
                  interpretation and allows the use of simple but efficient
                  sampling procedures. The resulting process possesses some
                  powerful convergence properties in the presence of noise; it
                  is nonparametric and, despite its generality, is efficient in
                  the use of observations. The approach seems quite promising
                  as a solution to many of the problems of experimental system
                  optimization.},

                  allow generating random correlation matrices from the same
                  joint distribution as the vine method. The methods are
                  compared in terms of time necessary to generate 5000 random

  abstract =     {Traffic signals play a critical role in smart cities for
                  mitigating traffic congestions and reducing the emission in
                  metropolitan areas. This paper proposes a bi-level
                  optimization framework to settle the optimal traffic signal
                  setting problem. The upper-level problem determines the
                  traffic signal settings to minimize the drivers' average
                  travel time, while the lower-level problem aims for achieving
                  the network equilibrium using the settings calculated at the
                  upper level. Genetic algorithm is employed with the
                  integration of microscopic-traffic-simulation based dynamic
                  traffic assignment (DTA) to decouple the complex bi-level
                  problem into tractable single-level problems which are solved
                  sequentially. Case studies on a synthetic traffic network and
                  a real-world traffic subnetwork are conducted to examine the
                  effectiveness of the proposed model and relevant solution
                  methods. Additional strategies are provided for the extension
                  of the proposed model and the acceleration solution process

While recent approaches use Bayesian optimization to adaptively select configurations, we focus on speeding up random search through adaptive resource allocation and early-stopping. We formulate hyperparameter optimization as a pure-exploration non-stochastic infinite-armed bandit problem where a predefined resource like iterations, data samples, or features is allocated to randomly sampled configurations. We introduce a novel algorithm, our algorithm, for this framework and analyze its theoretical properties, providing several desirable guarantees. Furthermore, we compare our algorithm with popular Bayesian optimization methods on a suite of hyperparameter optimization problems. We observe that our algorithm can provide over an order-of-magnitude speedup over our competitor set on a variety of deep-learning and kernel-based learning problems.},

  abstract     = {Most multi-objective optimisation algorithms maintain an
                  archive explicitly or implicitly during their search. Such an
                  archive can be solely used to store high-quality solutions
                  presented to the decision maker, but in many cases may
                  participate in the search process (e.g., as the population in
                  evolutionary computation). Over the last two decades,
                  archiving, the process of comparing new solutions with
                  previous ones and deciding how to update the
                  archive/population, stands as an important issue in
                  evolutionary multi-objective optimisation (EMO). This is
                  evidenced by constant efforts from the community on
                  developing various effective archiving methods, ranging from
                  conventional Pareto-based methods to more recent
                  indicator-based and decomposition-based ones. However, the
                  focus of these efforts is on empirical performance comparison
                  in terms of specific quality indicators; there is lack of
                  systematic study of archiving methods from a general
                  theoretical perspective. In this paper, we attempt to conduct
                  a systematic overview of multi-objective archiving, in the
                  hope of paving the way to understand archiving algorithms
                  from a holistic perspective of theory and practice, and more
                  importantly providing a guidance on how to design
                  theoretically desirable and practically useful archiving
                  algorithms. In doing so, we also present that archiving
                  algorithms based on weakly Pareto compliant indicators (e.g.,
                  $\epsilon$-indicator), as long as designed properly, can
                  achieve the same theoretical desirables as archivers based on
                  Pareto compliant indicators (e.g., hypervolume
                  indicator). Such desirables include the property
                  limit-optimal, the limit form of the possible optimal
                  property that a bounded archiving algorithm can have with
                  respect to the most general form of superiority between
                  solution sets.}

                  defined by a neighborhood structure and a dominance relation
                  that iteratively improve an archive of nondominated
                  solutions. Such methods are referred to as dominance-based

                  results for the special case of 1-MMAS, it is studied to what
                  extent an enlarged colony using $\lambda$ ants per vertex

                  easy cases of oscillations can be tracked by a constant

                  involved oscillations that with overwhelming probability
                  cannot be tracked with any polynomial-size colony. Finally,
                  parameters of dynamic shortest-path problems which make the

                  a difficult optimization problem that arises, for
                  example, in logistics. This paper deals with the
                  minimization of the travel-cost. For solving this
                  problem, this paper proposes a Beam-ACO algorithm,
                  which is a hybrid method combining ant colony
                  optimization with beam search.  In general, Beam-ACO
                  algorithms heavily rely on accurate and
                  computationally inexpensive bounding information for
                  differentiating between partial solutions. This work
                  uses stochastic sampling as a useful alternative. An
                  extensive experimental evaluation on seven benchmark
                  sets from the literature shows that the proposed
                  Beam-ACO algorithm is currently a state-of-the-art
                  technique for the travelling salesman problem with

abstract = {Reducing energy consumption of water distribution
  networks has never had more significance than today. The greatest
  energy savings can be obtained by careful scheduling of operation of
  pumps. Schedules can be defined either implicitly, in terms of other
  elements of the network such as tank levels, or explicitly by
  specifying the time during which each pump is on/off. The
  traditional representation of explicit schedules is a string of
  binary values with each bit representing pump on/off status during a
  particular time interval. In this paper a new explicit
  representation is presented. It is based on time controlled
  triggers, where the maximum number of pump switches is specified
  beforehand. In this representation a pump schedule is divided into a
  series of integers with each integer representing the number of
  hours for which a pump is active/inactive. This reduces the number
  of potential schedules (search space) compared to the binary
  representation. Ant colony optimization (ACO) is a stochastic
  meta-heuristic for combinatorial optimization problems that is
  inspired by the foraging behavior of some species of ants. In this
  paper, an application of the ACO framework was developed for the
  optimal scheduling of pumps. The proposed representation was adapted
  to an ant colony Optimization framework and solved for the optimal
  pump schedules. Minimization of electrical cost was considered as
  the objective, while satisfying system constraints. Instead of using
  a penalty function approach for constraint violations, constraint
  violations were ordered according to their importance and solutions
  were ranked based on this order. The proposed approach was tested on
  a small test network and on a large real-world network. Results are
  compared with those obtained using a simple genetic algorithm based
  on binary representation and a hybrid genetic algorithm that uses
  level-based triggers.}

                  distribution networks has never had more
                  significance. The greatest energy savings can be
                  obtained by carefully scheduling the operations of
                  pumps. Schedules can be defined either implicitly,
                  in terms of other elements of the network such as
                  tank levels, or explicitly by specifying the time
                  during which each pump is on/off.  The traditional
                  representation of explicit schedules is a string of
                  binary values with each bit representing pump on/off
                  status during a particular time interval.  In this
                  paper, we formally define and analyze two new
                  explicit representations based on time-controlled
                  triggers, where the maximum number of pump switches
                  is established beforehand and the schedule may
                  contain less switches than the maximum. In these
                  representations, a pump schedule is divided into a
                  series of integers with each integer representing
                  the number of hours for which a pump is
                  active/inactive.  This reduces the number of
                  potential schedules compared to the binary
                  representation, and allows the algorithm to operate
                  on the feasible region of the search space.  We
                  propose evolutionary operators for these two new
                  representations. The new representations and their
                  corresponding operations are compared with the two
                  most-used representations in pump scheduling,
                  namely, binary representation and level-controlled
                  triggers. A detailed statistical analysis of the
                  results indicates which parameters have the greatest
                  effect on the performance of evolutionary
                  algorithms. The empirical results show that an
                  evolutionary algorithm using the proposed
                  representations improves over the results obtained

Multi-objective optimization problems are problems with several,
typically conflicting criteria for evaluating solutions. Without
any a priori preference information, the Pareto optimality
principle establishes a partial order among solutions, and the
output of the algorithm becomes a set of nondominated solutions
rather than a single one. Various ant colony optimization (ACO)
algorithms have been proposed in recent years for solving such
problems. These multi-objective ACO (MOACO) algorithms exhibit
different design choices for dealing with the particularities of
the multi-objective context. This paper proposes a formulation of
algorithmic components that suffices to describe most MOACO
algorithms proposed so far. This formulation also shows that
existing MOACO algorithms often share equivalent design choices
but they are described in different terms. Moreover, this
formulation is synthesized into a flexible algorithmic framework,
from which not only existing MOACO algorithms may be
instantiated, but also combinations of components that were never
studied in the literature. In this sense, this paper goes beyond
proposing a new MOACO algorithm, but it rather introduces a
family of MOACO algorithms. The flexibility of the proposed MOACO
framework facilitates the application of automatic algorithm
configuration techniques. The experimental results presented in
this paper show that the automatically configured MOACO framework
outperforms the MOACO algorithms that inspired the framework
itself. This paper is also among the first to apply automatic
algorithm configuration techniques to multi-objective algorithms.}

                  the computation time allowed. Designing algorithms with good
                  anytime behaviour is a difficult task, because performance is
                  often evaluated subjectively, by plotting the trade-off curve
                  between computation time and solution quality. Yet, the
                  trade-off curve may be modelled also as a set of mutually
                  nondominated, bi-objective points. Using this model, we
                  propose to combine an automatic configuration tool and the
                  hypervolume measure, which assigns a single quality measure
                  to a nondominated set. This allows us to improve the anytime

                  automatically finding algorithmic configurations that produce
                  the best nondominated sets. Moreover, the recently proposed

                  decision-maker's preferences into the automatic tuning

                  System and (ii) the tuning of the anytime behaviour of SCIP,

                  to a project is limited and not sufficient to
                  execute all the concurrent activities. In this
                  situation, decision making about their schedule is
                  necessary. Many times this schedule supposes an
                  increase in the project completion
                  time. Additionally, companies commonly manage
                  various projects simultaneously, sharing a pool of
                  renewable resources. Given these resource
                  constraints, we often can only apply heuristic
                  methods to solve the scheduling problem. In this
                  work the effect of the schedule generation schemes -
                  serial or parallel - and priority rules - {MINLFT},
                  {MINSLK}, {MAXTWK}, {SASP} or {FCFS} - with two
                  approaches - multi-project and single-project - are

                  project delay and the multiproject duration
                  increase. Through an extensive computational study,
                  results show that with the parallel scheduling
                  generation scheme and the multi-project approach the
                  project manager can obtain a good multiproject
                  schedule with the time criterion selected:
                  minimising mean project delay or minimising
                  multiproject duration increase. New heuristics -
                  based on priority rules with a two-phase approach -
                  that outperform classical ones are proposed to
                  minimise mean project delay with a multi-project
                  approach. Finally, the best heuristics analysed are

  abstract =     {The Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) is an evaluation
                  platform that poses the challenge of building AI agents with
                  general competency across dozens of Atari 2600 games. It
                  supports a variety of different problem settings and it has
                  been receiving increasing attention from the scientific
                  community, leading to some high-pro_le success stories such
                  as the much publicized Deep Q-Networks (DQN). In this article
                  we take a big picture look at how the ALE is being used by
                  the research community. We show how diverse the evaluation
                  methodologies in the ALE have become with time, and highlight
                  some key concerns when evaluating agents in the ALE. We use
                  this discussion to present some methodological best practices
                  and provide new benchmark results using these best
                  practices. To further the progress in the field, we introduce
                  a new version of the ALE that supports multiple game modes
                  and provides a form of stochasticity we call sticky
                  actions. We conclude this big picture look by revisiting
                  challenges posed when the ALE was introduced, summarizing the
                  state-of-the-art in various problems and highlighting
                  problems that remain open.},

                  tuning these parameters is presented. The IHS algorithm has
                  been successfully applied to various benchmarking and
                  standard engineering optimization problems. Numerical results
                  reveal that the proposed algorithm can find better solutions

                  approaches for MODM problems. ISGP is applicable to both

                  objective optimization techniques and, hence, available
                  computer codes utilizing these techniques can be adapted for
                  use in ISGP. The non-dominance of the "best-compromise"
                  solution is assured. The information required from the
                  decision maker in each iteration is simple. The proposed
                  method is illustrated by solving a nutrition problem.}

  abstract     = {For offline data-driven multiobjective optimization problems
                  (MOPs), no new data is available during the optimization
                  process. Approximation models (or surrogates) are first built
                  using the provided offline data and an optimizer, e.g. a
                  multiobjective evolutionary algorithm, can then be utilized
                  to find Pareto optimal solutions to the problem with
                  surrogates as objective functions. In contrast to online
                  data-driven MOPs, these surrogates cannot be updated with new
                  data and, hence, the approximation accuracy cannot be
                  improved by considering new data during the optimization
                  process. Gaussian process regression (GPR) models are widely
                  used as surrogates because of their ability to provide
                  uncertainty information. However, building GPRs becomes
                  computationally expensive when the size of the dataset is
                  large. Using sparse GPRs reduces the computational cost of
                  building the surrogates. However, sparse GPRs are not
                  tailored to solve offline data-driven MOPs, where good
                  accuracy of the surrogates is needed near Pareto optimal
                  solutions. Treed GPR (TGPR-MO) surrogates for offline
                  data-driven MOPs with continuous decision variables are
                  proposed in this paper. The proposed surrogates first split
                  the decision space into subregions using regression trees and
                  build GPRs sequentially in regions close to Pareto optimal
                  solutions in the decision space to accurately approximate
                  tradeoffs between the objective functions. TGPR-MO surrogates
                  are computationally inexpensive because GPRs are built only
                  in a smaller region of the decision space utilizing a subset
                  of the data. The TGPR-MO surrogates were tested on
                  distance-based visualizable problems with various data sizes,
                  sampling strategies, numbers of objective functions, and
                  decision variables. Experimental results showed that the
                  TGPR-MO surrogates are computationally cheaper and can handle

                  each output, a certificate or witness (easy-to-verify proof)
                  that the particular output has not been compromised by a
                  bug. A user of a certifying algorithm inputs x, receives the
                  output y and the certificate w, and then checks, either
                  manually or by use of a program, that w proves that y is a
                  correct output for input x. In this way, he/she can be sure
                  of the correctness of the output without having to trust the
                  algorithm. We put forward the thesis that certifying
                  algorithms are much superior to non-certifying algorithms,
                  and that for complex algorithmic tasks, only certifying
                  algorithms are satisfactory. Acceptance of this thesis would
                  lead to a change of how algorithms are taught and how
                  algorithms are researched. The widespread use of certifying
                  algorithms would greatly enhance the reliability of
                  algorithmic software. We survey the state of the art in
                  certifying algorithms and add to it. In particular, we start
                  a theory of certifying algorithms and prove that the concept
                  is universal.}

                  partially discrete non-linear problem with many
                  variables. The scheduling method described in this paper
                  typically produces costs within 1\% of a linear program-based
                  solution, and can incorporate realistic non-linear costs that
                  may be hard to incorporate in linear programming
                  formulations. These costs include pump switching and maximum
                  demand charges. A simplified model is derived from a standard
                  hydraulic simulator. An initial schedule is produced by a
                  descent method. Two-stage simulated annealing then produces
                  solutions in a few minutes. Iterative recalibration ensures
                  that the solution agrees closely with the results from a full
                  hydraulic simulation.}

                  Techniques and Simulation Speedups},
  abstract =     {Although experimental studies have been widely applied to the
                  investigation of algorithm performance, very little attention
                  has been given to experimental method in this area. This is
                  unfortunate, since much can be done to improve the quality of
                  the data obtained; often, much improvement may be needed for
                  the data to be useful. This paper gives a tutorial discussion
                  of two aspects of good experimental technique: the use of
                  variance reduction techniques and simulation speedups in
                  algorithm studies.  In an illustrative study, application of
                  variance reduction techniques produces a decrease in variance
                  by a factor 1000 in one case, giving a dramatic improvement
                  in the precision of experimental results. Furthermore, the
                  complexity of the simulation program is improved from
                  $\Theta(m n/H_n)$ to $\Theta(m + n \log n)$ (where $m$ is
                  typically much larger than $n$), giving a much faster
                  simulation program and therefore more data per unit of
                  computation time. The general application of variance
                  reduction techniques is also discussed for a variety of

                  impairment in at least one objective function to get a new
                  solution. The NAUTILUS method proposed is based on the
                  assumptions that past experiences affect decision makers'
                  hopes and that people do not react symmetrically to gains and
                  losses. Therefore, some decision makers may prefer to start
                  from the worst possible objective values and to improve every
                  objective step by step according to their preferences. In
                  NAUTILUS, starting from the nadir point, a solution is
                  obtained at each iteration which dominates the previous
                  one. Although only the last solution will be Pareto optimal,
                  the decision maker never looses sight of the Pareto optimal
                  set, and the search is oriented so that (s)he progressively
                  focusses on the preferred part of the Pareto optimal
                  set. Each new solution is obtained by minimizing an
                  achievement scalarizing function including preferences about
                  desired improvements in objective function values. NAUTILUS
                  is specially suitable for avoiding undesired anchoring
                  effects, for example in negotiation support problems, or just
                  as a means of finding an initial Pareto optimal solution for
                  any interactive procedure. An illustrative example
                  demonstrates how this new method iterates.},

  abstract =     { This paper studies the learning process in an ant
                  colony optimization algorithm designed to solve the
                  problem of ordering cars on an assembly line
                  (car-sequencing problem). This problem has been
                  shown to be {NP-hard} and evokes a great deal of
                  interest among practitioners. Learning in an ant
                  algorithm is achieved by using an artificial
                  pheromone trail, which is a central element of this
                  metaheuristic. Many versions of the algorithm are
                  found in literature, the main distinction among them
                  being the management of the pheromone
                  trail. Nevertheless, few of them seek to perfect
                  learning by modifying the internal structure of the
                  trail. In this paper, a new pheromone trail
                  structure is proposed that is specifically adapted
                  to the type of constraints in the car-sequencing
                  problem. The quality of the results obtained when
                  solving three sets of benchmark problems is superior
                  to that of the best solutions found in literature
                  and shows the efficiency of the specialized trail.},

                  traveling salesman problem (TSP). To construct a powerful GA,
                  we use edge assembly crossover (EAX) and make substantial
                  enhancements to it: (i) localization of EAX together with its
                  efficient implementation and (ii) the use of a local search
                  procedure in EAX to determine good combinations of building
                  blocks of parent solutions for generating even better
                  offspring solutions from very high-quality parent
                  solutions. In addition, we develop (iii) an innovative
                  selection model for maintaining population diversity at a
                  negligible computational cost. Experimental results on
                  well-studied TSP benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed GA
                  outperforms state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms in finding
                  very high-quality solutions on instances with up to 200,000
                  cities. In contrast to the state-of-the-art TSP heuristics,
                  which are all based on the Lin-Kernighan (LK) algorithm, our
                  GA achieves top performance without using an LK-based
                  algorithm.}

                  (MOPSOs) progresses by proposing one new MOPSO at a time. In
                  spite of the commonalities among different MOPSOs, it is
                  often unclear which algorithmic components are crucial for
                  explaining the performance of a particular MOPSO
                  design. Moreover, it is expected that different designs may
                  perform best on different problem families and identifying a
                  best overall MOPSO is a challenging task. We tackle this
                  challenge here by: (1) proposing AutoMOPSO, a flexible
                  algorithmic template for designing MOPSOs with a design space
                  that can instantiate thousands of potential MOPSOs; and (2)
                  searching for good-performing MOPSO designs given a family of
                  training problems by means of an automatic configuration tool
                  (irace). We apply this automatic design methodology to
                  generate a MOPSO that significantly outperforms two
                  state-of-the-art MOPSOs on four well-known bi-objective
                  problem families. We also identify the key design choices and
                  parameters of the winning MOPSO by means of
                  ablation. AutoMOPSO is publicly available as part of the
                  jMetal framework.}

                  observations. This distinction between postdiction and
                  prediction is appreciated conceptually but is not respected
                  in practice. Mistaking generation of postdictions with
                  testing of predictions reduces the credibility of research
                  findings. However, ordinary biases in human reasoning, such
                  as hindsight bias, make it hard to avoid this mistake. An
                  effective solution is to define the research questions and
                  analysis plan before observing the research outcomes--a
                  process called preregistration. Preregistration distinguishes
                  analyses and outcomes that result from predictions from those
                  that result from postdictions. A variety of practical
                  strategies are available to make the best possible use of
                  preregistration in circumstances that fall short of the ideal
                  application, such as when the data are preexisting. Services
                  are now available for preregistration across all disciplines,
                  facilitating a rapid increase in the practice. Widespread
                  adoption of preregistration will increase distinctiveness
                  between hypothesis generation and hypothesis testing and will
                  improve the credibility of research findings.},

                  careful, manual algorithm engineering effort to reach high
                  performance. An alternative to the manual algorithm
                  engineering is the automated design of effective SLS
                  algorithms through building flexible algorithm frameworks and
                  using automatic algorithm configuration techniques to
                  instantiate high-performing algorithms. In this paper, we
                  automatically generate new high-performing algorithms for
                  some of the most widely studied variants of the PFSP. More in
                  detail, we (i) developed a new algorithm framework, EMILI,
                  that implements algorithm-specific and problem-specific
                  building blocks; (ii) define the rules of how to compose
                  algorithms from the building blocks; and (iii) employ an
                  automatic algorithm configuration tool to search for high
                  performing algorithm configurations. With these ingredients,
                  we automatically generate algorithms for the PFSP with the
                  objectives makespan, total completion time and total
                  tardiness, which outperform the best algorithms obtained by a

                  alternatives can also provide additional useful information
                  for the decision maker. However, obtaining all nearly optimal
                  solutions entails an excessive number of
                  alternatives. Therefore, to consider the nearly optimal
                  solutions, it is convenient to obtain a reduced set, putting
                  the focus on the potentially useful alternatives. These
                  solutions are the alternatives that are close to the optimal
                  solutions in objective space, but which differ significantly
                  in the decision space. To characterize this set, it is

                  process. The motivation of this work is to analyze the three
                  existing archiving strategies proposed in the literature
                  (ArchiveUpdate$P_{Q,\epsilon}D_{xy}$, Archive\_nevMOGA, and
                  targetSelect) that aim to characterize the potentially useful
                  solutions. The archivers are evaluated on two benchmarks and
                  in a real engineering example. The contribution clearly shows
                  the main differences between the three archivers. This
                  analysis is useful for the design of evolutionary algorithms
                  that consider nearly optimal solutions.",

                  for solving unconstrained multi-level lot-sizing
                  problems called ant system for multi-level
                  lot-sizing algorithm {(ASMLLS).} We apply a hybrid
                  approach where we use ant colony optimization in
                  order to find a good lot-sizing sequence, i.e. a
                  sequence of the different items in the product
                  structure in which we apply a modified
                  {Wagner-Whitin} algorithm for each item
                  separately. Based on the setup costs each ant
                  generates a sequence of items. Afterwards a simple
                  single-stage lot-sizing rule is applied with
                  modified setup costs. This modification of the setup
                  costs depends on the position of the item in the
                  lot-sizing sequence, on the items which have been
                  lot-sized before, and on two further parameters,
                  which are tried to be improved by a systematic
                  search. For small-sized problems {ASMLLS} is among
                  the best algorithms, but for most medium- and
                  large-sized problems it outperforms all other
                  approaches regarding solution quality as well as
                  computational time.},

                  which is termed the Multi-objective Menu Planning Problem, is
                  presented herein. Menu planning is of great interest in the
                  health field due to the importance of proper nutrition in
                  today's society, and particularly, in school
                  canteens. In addition to considering the cost of the meal
                  plan as the classic objective to be minimized, we also
                  introduce a second objective aimed at minimizing the degree
                  of repetition of courses and food groups that a particular
                  meal plan consists of. The motivation behind this particular
                  multi-objective formulation is to offer a meal plan that is
                  not only affordable but also varied and balanced from a
                  nutritional standpoint. The plan is designed for a given
                  number of days and ensures that the specific nutritional
                  requirements of school-age children are satisfied. The main
                  goal of the current work is to demonstrate the
                  multi-objective nature of the said formulation, through a
                  comprehensive experimental assessment carried out over a set
                  of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms applied to
                  different instances. At the same time, we are also interested
                  in validating the multi-objective formulation by performing
                  quantitative and qualitative analyses of the solutions
                  attained when solving it. Computational results show the
                  multi-objective nature of the said formulation, as well as
                  that it allows suitable meal plans to be obtained.}

                  on all links is known as the capacitated minimum
                  spanning tree {(CMST)} problem. As the problem is
                  {NP-hard,} we propose a hybrid ant colony
                  optimization {(ACO)} algorithm to tackle it
                  heuristically. The algorithm exploits two important
                  problem characteristics: (i) the {CMST} problem is
                  closely related to the capacitated vehicle routing
                  problem {(CVRP),} and (ii) given a clustering of
                  client nodes that satisfies capacity constraints,
                  the solution is to find a {MST} for each cluster,
                  which can be done exactly in polynomial time. Our
                  {ACO} exploits these two characteristics of the
                  {CMST} by a solution construction originally
                  developed for the {CVRP.} Given the {CVRP} solution,
                  we then apply an implementation of Prim's algorithm
                  to each cluster to obtain a feasible {CMST}
                  solution. Results from a comprehensive computational
                  study indicate the efficiency and effectiveness of
                  the proposed approach.},

  abstract =     {The problem of selecting an effective algorithm arises in a
                  wide variety of situations. This chapter starts with a
                  discussion on abstract models: the basic model and associated
                  problems, the model with selection based on features, and the
                  model with variable performance criteria. One objective of
                  this chapter is to explore the applicability of the
                  approximation theory to the algorithm selection
                  problem. There is an intimate relationship here and that the
                  approximation theory forms an appropriate base upon which to
                  develop a theory of algorithm selection methods. The
                  approximation theory currently lacks much of the necessary
                  machinery for the algorithm selection problem. There is a
                  need to develop new results and apply known techniques to
                  these new circumstances. The final pages of this chapter form
                  a sort of appendix, which lists 15 specific open problems and
                  questions in this area. There is a close relationship between
                  the algorithm selection problem and the general optimization
                  theory. This is not surprising since the approximation
                  problem is a special form of the optimization problem. Most
                  realistic algorithm selection problems are of moderate to
                  high dimensionality and thus one should expect them to be
                  quite complex. One consequence of this is that most
                  straightforward approaches (even well-conceived ones) are
                  likely to lead to enormous computations for the best
                  selection. The single most important part of the solution of
                  a selection problem is the appropriate choice of the form for
                  selection mapping. It is here that theories give the least
                  guidance and that the art of problem solving is most
                  crucial.}

                  prediction model called MAKER-RIMER to examine how different
                  features embedded in Twitter posts (tweets) can predict the
                  number of retweets achieved during an electoral campaign. The
                  tweets posted by the two most voted candidates during the
                  official campaign for the 2017 Ecuadorian Presidential
                  election were used for this research. For each tweet, five
                  features including type of tweet, emotion, URL, hashtag, and
                  date are identified and coded to predict if tweets are of
                  either high or low impact. The main contributions of the new
                  proposed model include its suitability to analyse tweet
                  datasets based on likelihood analysis of data. The model is
                  interpretable, and the prediction process relies only on the
                  use of available data. The experimental results show that
                  MAKER-RIMER performed better, in terms of misclassification
                  error, when compared against other predictive machine
                  learning approaches. In addition, the model allows observing
                  which features of the candidates' tweets are linked to high
                  and low impact. Tweets containing allusions to the contender
                  candidate, either with positive or negative connotations,
                  without hashtags, and written towards the end of the
                  campaign, were persistently those with the highest
                  impact. URLs, on the other hand, is the only variable that
                  performs differently for the two candidates in terms of
                  achieving high impact. MAKER-RIMER can provide campaigners of
                  political parties or candidates with a tool to measure how
                  features of tweets are predictors of their impact, which can
                  be useful to tailor Twitter content during electoral
                  campaigns.},

  abstract     = {When solving multiobjective optimization problems,
                  preference-based evolutionary multiobjective optimization
                  (EMO) algorithms introduce preference information into an
                  evolutionary algorithm in order to focus the search for
                  objective vectors towards the region of interest of the
                  Pareto optimal front. In this paper, we suggest a
                  preference-based EMO algorithm called weighting achievement
                  scalarizing function genetic algorithm (WASF-GA), which
                  considers the preferences of the decision maker (DM)
                  expressed by means of a reference point. The main purpose of
                  WASF-GA is to approximate the region of interest of the
                  Pareto optimal front determined by the reference point, which
                  contains the Pareto optimal objective vectors that obey the
                  preferences expressed by the DM in the best possible way. The
                  proposed approach is based on the use of an achievement
                  scalarizing function (ASF) and on the classification of the
                  individuals into several fronts. At each generation of
                  WASF-GA, this classification is done according to the values
                  that each solution takes on the ASF for the reference point
                  and using different weight vectors. These vectors of weights
                  are selected so that the vectors formed by their inverse
                  components constitute a well-distributed representation of
                  the weight vectors space. The efficiency and usefulness of
                  WASF-GA is shown in several test problems in comparison to
                  other preference-based EMO algorithms. Regarding a metric
                  based on the hypervolume, we can say that WASF-GA has
                  outperformed the other algorithms considered in most of the
                  problems.}

                  techniques for the multi-objective orienteering
                  problem are developed. The motivation stems from the
                  problem of planning individual tourist routes in a
                  city. Each point of interest in a city provides
                  different benefits for different categories (e.g.,
                  culture, shopping). Each tourist has different
                  preferences for the different categories when
                  selecting and visiting the points of interests
                  (e.g., museums, churches). Hence, a multi-objective
                  decision situation arises.  To determine all the
                  Pareto optimal solutions, two metaheuristic search
                  techniques are developed and applied. We use the
                  Pareto ant colony optimization algorithm and extend
                  the design of the variable neighborhood search
                  method to the multi-objective case. Both methods are
                  hybridized with path relinking procedures. The
                  performances of the two algorithms are tested on
                  several benchmark instances as well as on real world
                  instances from different Austrian regions and the
                  cities of Vienna and Padua.  The computational
                  results show that both implemented methods are well
                  performing algorithms to solve the multi-objective
                  orienteering problem.},

                  typically assume that all objectives that are relevant to the
                  decision-maker (DM) are optimized by the EMOA. In some
                  scenarios, however, there are irrelevant objectives that are
                  optimized by the EMOA but ignored by the DM, as well as,
                  hidden objectives that the DM considers when judging the
                  utility of solutions but are not optimized. This discrepancy
                  between the EMOA and the DM's preferences may impede the
                  search for the most-preferred solution and waste resources
                  evaluating irrelevant objectives. Research on objective
                  reduction has focused so far on the structure of the problem
                  and correlations between objectives and neglected the role of
                  the DM. We formally define here the concepts of irrelevant
                  and hidden objectives and propose methods for detecting them,
                  based on uni-variate feature selection and recursive feature
                  elimination, that use the preferences already elicited when a
                  DM interacts with a ranking-based interactive EMOA
                  (iEMOA). We incorporate the detection methods into an iEMOA
                  capable of dynamically switching the objectives being
                  optimized. Our experiments show that this approach can
                  efficiently identify which objectives are relevant to the DM
                  and reduce the number of objectives being optimized, while
                  keeping and often improving the utility, according to the DM,
                  of the best solution found.}

                  the solution of such scenario-based multiobjective
                  optimization problems. Suitable graphical visualizations are
                  necessary to support managers in understanding, evaluating,
                  and comparing the performances of management decisions
                  according to all objectives in all plausible scenarios. To
                  date, no appropriate visualization has been suggested. This
                  paper fills this gap by proposing two visualization methods:
                  a novel extension of empirical attainment functions for
                  scenarios and an adapted version of heatmaps. They help a
                  decision-maker in gaining insight into realizations of
                  trade-offs and comparisons between objective functions in
                  different scenarios. Some fundamental questions that a
                  decision-maker may wish to answer with the help of
                  visualizations are also identified. Several examples are
                  utilized to illustrate how the proposed visualizations
                  support a decision-maker in evaluating and comparing
                  solutions to be able to make a robust decision by answering
                  the questions. Finally, we validate the usefulness of the
                  proposed visualizations in a real-world problem with a real
                  decision-maker. We conclude with guidelines regarding which

  abstract =     "This paper presents a scenario-based Multi-Objective
                  structure to handle decision problems under deep
                  uncertainty. Most of the decisions in real-life problems need
                  to be made in the absence of complete knowledge about the
                  consequences of the decision and/or are characterised by
                  uncertainties about the future which is unpredictable. These
                  uncertainties are almost impossible to reduce by gathering
                  more information and are not statistical in
                  nature. Therefore, classical probability-based approaches,
                  such as stochastic programming, do not address these
                  problems; as they require a correctly-defined complete sample
                  space, strong assumptions (e.g. normality), or both. The
                  proposed method extends the concept of two-stage stochastic
                  programming with recourse to address the capability of
                  dealing with deep uncertainty through the use of scenario
                  planning rather than statistical expectation. In this
                  research, scenarios are used as a dimension of preference to
                  avoid problems relating to the assessment and use of
                  probabilities under deep uncertainty. Such scenario-based
                  thinking involved a multi-objective representation of
                  performance under different future conditions as an
                  alternative to expectation. To the best of our knowledge,
                  this is the first attempt of performing a multi-criteria
                  evaluation under deep uncertainty through a structured
                  optimisation model. The proposed structure replacing
                  probabilities (in dynamic systems with deep uncertainties) by
                  aspirations within a goal programming structure. In fact,
                  this paper also proposes an extension of the goal programming
                  paradigm to deal with deep uncertainty. Furthermore, we will
                  explain how this structure can be modelled, implemented, and
                  solved by Goal Programming using some simple, but not
                  trivial, examples. Further discussion and comparisons with
                  some popular existing methods will also provided to highlight
                  the superiorities of the proposed structure.",

                  supply chains (SCs) under deep uncertainty has been addressed
                  by applying a two-stage scenario-based multiobjective
                  optimisation methodology. In practice, the depth of
                  uncertainty is very high, potential outcomes are not
                  precisely enumerable, and probabilities of outcomes are not
                  properly definable. To date, no appropriate framework has
                  been suggested for dealing with deep uncertainty in supply
                  chain management and energy-related problems. This study is
                  the first try to fills this gap. Particularly, the
                  sustainability of the whole infrastructure of the
                  sugar-bioethanol SCs is analysed in such a way that the final
                  solutions are sustainable, robust and adaptable for a broad
                  range of plausible futures. Three objectives are considered
                  in this problem under six uncertain parameters. A case study
                  of South African sugarcane industry is utilised to study and
                  examine the proposed model. The results prove the economic
                  profitability and sustainability of the project."

  abstract     = {Increasing accuracy motivation (e.g., by providing monetary
                  incentives for accuracy) often fails to increase adjustment
                  away from provided anchors, a result that has led researchers
                  to conclude that people do not effortfully adjust away from
                  such anchors. We challenge this conclusion. First, we show
                  that people are typically uncertain about which way to adjust
                  from provided anchors and that this uncertainty often causes
                  people to believe that they have initially adjusted too far
                  away from such anchors (Studies 1a and 1b). Then, we show
                  that although accuracy motivation fails to increase the gap
                  between anchors and final estimates when people are uncertain
                  about the direction of adjustment, accuracy motivation does
                  increase anchor-estimate gaps when people are certain about
                  the direction of adjustment, and that this is true regardless
                  of whether the anchors are provided or self-generated
                  (Studies 2, 3a, 3b, and 5). These results suggest that people
                  do effortfully adjust away from provided anchors but that
                  uncertainty about the direction of adjustment makes that
                  adjustment harder to detect than previously assumed. This
                  conclusion has important theoretical implications, suggesting
                  that currently emphasized distinctions between anchor types
                  (self-generated vs. provided) are not fundamental and that
                  ostensibly competing theories of anchoring (selective
                  accessibility and anchoring-and-adjustment) are
                  complementary.},

  abstract =     {Many-objective optimization refers to the optimization
                  problems containing large number of objectives, typically
                  more than four.  Non-dominance is an inadequate strategy for
                  convergence to the Pareto front for such problems, as almost
                  all solutions in the population become non-dominated,
                  resulting in loss of convergence pressure.  However, for some
                  problems, it may be possible to generate the Pareto front
                  using only a few of the objectives, rendering the rest of the
                  objectives redundant. Such problems may be reducible to a
                  manageable number of relevant objectives, which can be
                  optimized using conventional multiobjective evolutionary
                  algorithms (MOEAs). For dimensionality reduction, most
                  proposals in the paper rely on analysis of a representative
                  set of solutions obtained by running a conventional MOEA for
                  a large number of generations, which is computationally
                  overbearing.  A novel algorithm, Pareto corner search
                  evolutionary algorithm (PCSEA), is introduced in this paper,
                  which searches for the corners of the Pareto front instead of
                  searching for the complete Pareto front. The solutions
                  obtained using PCSEA are then used for dimensionality
                  reduction to identify the relevant objectives. The potential
                  of the proposed approach is demonstrated by studying its
                  performance on a set of benchmark test problems and two
                  engineering examples. While the preliminary results obtained
                  using PCSEA are promising, there are a number of areas that
                  need further investigation. This paper provides a number of
                  useful insights into dimensionality reduction and, in
                  particular, highlights some of the roadblocks that need to be
                  cleared for future development of algorithms attempting to
                  use few selected solutions for identifying relevant
                  objectives},

  abstract =     {A number of practical optimization problems are posed as
                  many-objective (more than three objectives) problems. Most of
                  the existing evolutionary multi-objective optimization
                  algorithms, which target the entire Pareto-front are not
                  equipped to handle many-objective problems. Though there have
                  been copious efforts to overcome the challenges posed by such
                  problems, there does not exist a generic procedure to
                  effectively handle them. This paper presents a simplify and
                  solve framework for handling many-objective optimization
                  problems. In that, a given problem is simplified by
                  identification and elimination of the redundant objectives,
                  before interactively engaging the decision maker to converge
                  to the most preferred solution on the Pareto-optimal
                  front. The merit of performing objective reduction before
                  interacting with the decision maker is two fold. Firstly, the
                  revelation that certain objectives are redundant,
                  significantly reduces the complexity of the optimization
                  problem, implying lower computational cost and higher search
                  efficiency. Secondly, it is well known that human beings are
                  not efficient in handling several factors (objectives in the
                  current context) at a time. Hence, simplifying the problem a
                  priori addresses the fundamental issue of cognitive overload
                  for the decision maker, which may help avoid inconsistent
                  preferences during the different stages of interactive
                  engagement. The implementation of the proposed framework is
                  first demonstrated on a three-objective problem, followed by
                  its application on two real-world engineering problems.}

                  we select test instances so that the generalization of
                  algorithm performance on future instances can be inferred. In
                  recent work, we have established a methodology to generate a
                  2-d representation of the instance space, comprising a set of
                  known test instances. This instance space shows the

                  performance of algorithms to be viewed across the instance

  abstract     = {Instance Space Analysis (ISA) is a recently developed
                  methodology to (a) support objective testing of algorithms
                  and (b) assess the diversity of test instances. Representing
                  test instances as feature vectors, the ISA methodology
                  extends Rice's 1976 Algorithm Selection Problem framework to
                  enable visualization of the entire space of possible test
                  instances, and gain insights into how algorithm performance
                  is affected by instance properties. Rather than reporting
                  algorithm performance on average across a chosen set of test
                  problems, as is standard practice, the ISA methodology offers
                  a more nuanced understanding of the unique strengths and
                  weaknesses of algorithms across different regions of the
                  instance space that may otherwise be hidden on average. It
                  also facilitates objective assessment of any bias in the
                  chosen test instances and provides guidance about the
                  adequacy of benchmark test suites. This article is a
                  comprehensive tutorial on the ISA methodology that has been
                  evolving over several years, and includes details of all
                  algorithms and software tools that are enabling its worldwide
                  adoption in many disciplines. A case study comparing
                  algorithms for university timetabling is presented to
                  illustrate the methodology and tools.},

  abstract =     "Automatic configuration techniques are widely and
                  successfully used to find good parameter settings for
                  optimization algorithms. Configuration is costly, because it
                  is necessary to evaluate many configurations on different
                  instances. For decision problems, when the objective is to
                  minimize the running time of the algorithm, many
                  configurators implement capping methods to discard poor
                  configurations early. Such methods are not directly
                  applicable to optimization problems, when the objective is to
                  optimize the cost of the best solution found, given a
                  predefined running time limit. We propose new capping methods
                  for the automatic configuration of optimization
                  algorithms. They use the previous executions to determine a
                  performance envelope, which is used to evaluate new
                  executions and cap those that do not satisfy the envelope
                  conditions. We integrate the capping methods into the irace
                  configurator and evaluate them on different optimization
                  scenarios. Our results show that the proposed methods can
                  save from about 5\% to 78\% of the configuration effort,
                  while finding configurations of the same quality. Based on
                  the computational analysis, we identify two conservative and
                  two aggressive methods, that save an average of about 20\%
                  and 45\% of the configuration effort, respectively. We also
                  provide evidence that capping can help to better use the
                  available budget in scenarios with a configuration time
                  limit."

                  the most relevant problems related to smart mobility: the
                  reduction of vehicles' travel time. Our original approach,
                  called Red Swarm, suggests a potentially customized route to
                  each vehicle by using several spots located at traffic lights
                  in order to avoid traffic jams by using \{V2I\}
                  communications. That is quite different from other existing
                  proposals, as it deals with real maps and actual streets, as
                  well as several road traffic distributions. We propose an
                  evolutionary algorithm (later efficiently parallelized) to
                  optimize our case studies which have been imported from
                  OpenStreetMap into \{SUMO\} as they belong to a real city. We
                  have also developed a Rerouting Algorithm which accesses the
                  configuration of the Red Swarm and communicates the route
                  chosen to vehicles, using the spots (via WiFi
                  link). Moreover, we have developed three competing algorithms
                  in order to compare their results to those of Red Swarm and
                  have observed that Red Swarm not only achieved the best
                  results, but also outperformed the experts' solutions in a
                  total of 60 scenarios tested, with up to 19\% shorter travel
                  times."

  abstract     = "In this paper, we present a novel computational approach to
                  the analysis of accent variation. The case study is dialect
                  leveling in the North of England, manifested as reduction of
                  accent variation across the North and emergence of General
                  Northern English (GNE), a pan-regional standard accent
                  associated with middle-class speakers. We investigated this
                  instance of dialect leveling using random forest
                  classification, with audio data from a crowd-sourced corpus
                  of 105 urban, mostly highly-educated speakers from five
                  northern UK cities: Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle
                  upon Tyne, and Sheffield. We trained random forest models to
                  identify individual northern cities from a sample of other
                  northern accents, based on first two formant measurements of
                  full vowel systems. We tested the models using unseen
                  data. We relied on undersampling, bagging (bootstrap
                  aggregation) and leave-one-out cross-validation to address
                  some challenges associated with the data set, such as
                  unbalanced data and relatively small sample size. The
                  accuracy of classification provides us with a measure of
                  relative similarity between different pairs of cities, while
                  calculating conditional feature importance allows us to
                  identify which input features (which vowels and which
                  formants) have the largest influence in the prediction. We do
                  find a considerable degree of leveling, especially between
                  Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield, although some differences
                  persist. The features that contribute to these differences
                  most systematically are typically not the ones discussed in
                  previous dialect descriptions. We propose that the most
                  systematic regional features are also not salient, and as
                  such, they serve as sociolinguistic regional indicators. We
                  supplement the random forest results with a more traditional
                  variationist description of by-city vowel systems, and we use
                  both sources of evidence to inform a description of the
                  vowels of General Northern English."

                  to sequential decision making under uncertainty, which
                  require the decisions made at every step to be both
                  informative of the optimal decision and also safe. For
                  example, we value both efficacy and comfort in medical
                  therapy, and efficiency and safety in robotic control. We
                  consider this problem of optimizing an unknown utility
                  function with absolute feedback or preference feedback
                  subject to unknown safety constraints. We develop an
                  efficient safe Bayesian optimization algorithm, StageOpt,
                  that separates safe region expansion and utility function
                  maximization into two distinct stages. Compared to existing
                  approaches which interleave between expansion and
                  optimization, we show that StageOpt is more efficient and
                  naturally applicable to a broader class of problems. We
                  provide theoretical guarantees for both the satisfaction of
                  safety constraints as well as convergence to the optimal
                  utility value. We evaluate StageOpt on both a variety of
                  synthetic experiments, as well as in clinical practice. We
                  demonstrate that StageOpt is more effective than existing
                  safe optimization approaches, and is able to safely and
                  effectively optimize spinal cord stimulation therapy in our

                  materials with their professional knowledge and
                  techniques. At the highest level of abstraction, this process
                  is formulated as black-box optimization. For instance, the
                  trial-and-error process of synthesizing various molecules for
                  better material properties can be regarded as optimizing a
                  black-box function describing the relation between a chemical
                  formula and its properties. Various black-box optimization
                  algorithms have been developed in the machine learning and
                  statistics communities. Recently, a number of researchers
                  have reported successful applications of such algorithms to
                  chemistry. They include the design of photofunctional
                  molecules and medical drugs, optimization of thermal emission
                  materials and high Li-ion conductive solid electrolytes, and
                  discovery of a new phase in inorganic thin films for solar
                  cells.There are a wide variety of algorithms available for
                  black-box optimization, such as Bayesian optimization,
                  reinforcement learning, and active learning. Practitioners
                  need to select an appropriate algorithm or, in some cases,
                  develop novel algorithms to meet their demands. It is also
                  necessary to determine how to best combine machine learning
                  techniques with quantum mechanics- and molecular
                  mechanics-based simulations, and experiments. In this
                  Account, we give an overview of recent studies regarding
                  automated discovery, design, and optimization based on
                  black-box optimization. The Account covers the following
                  algorithms: Bayesian optimization to optimize the chemical or
                  physical properties, an optimization method using a quantum
                  annealer, best-arm identification, gray-box optimization, and
                  reinforcement learning. In addition, we introduce active
                  learning and boundless objective-free exploration, which may
                  not fall into the category of black-box optimization.Data
                  quality and quantity are key for the success of these
                  automated discovery techniques. As laboratory automation and
                  robotics are put forward, automated discovery algorithms
                  would be able to match human performance at least in some
                  domains in the near future.}

                  preference information into evolutionary multi-objective
                  optimization and propose a preference-based evolutionary
                  approach that can be used as an integral part of an
                  interactive algorithm. One algorithm is proposed in the
                  paper. At each iteration, the decision maker is asked to give
                  preference information in terms of his or her reference point
                  consisting of desirable aspiration levels for objective
                  functions. The information is used in an evolutionary
                  algorithm to generate a new population by combining the
                  fitness function and an achievement scalarizing function. In
                  multi-objective optimization, achievement scalarizing
                  functions are widely used to project a given reference point
                  into the Pareto optimal set. In our approach, the next
                  population is thus more concentrated in the area where more
                  preferred alternatives are assumed to lie and the whole
                  Pareto optimal set does not have to be generated with equal
                  accuracy. The approach is demonstrated by numerical
                  examples. }

                  Evolutionary Multiple Objective Optimization with Stochastic
                  Ordinal Regression. The proposed methods ask the Decision
                  Maker (DM) to holistically compare, at regular intervals, a
                  pair of solutions, and use the Monte Carlo simulation to
                  construct a set of preference model instances compatible with
                  such indirect and incomplete information. The specific
                  variants of EMOSOR are distinguished by the following three
                  aspects. Firstly, they make use of two different preference
                  models, i.e., either an additive value function or a
                  Chebyshev function. Secondly, they aggregate the
                  acceptability indices derived from the stochastic analysis in
                  various ways, and use thus constructed indicators or
                  relations to sort the solutions obtained in each
                  generation. Thirdly, they incorporate different active
                  learning strategies for selecting pairs of solutions to be
                  critically judged by the DM. The extensive computational
                  experiments performed on a set of benchmark optimization
                  problems reveal that EMOSOR is able to bias an evolutionary
                  search towards a part of the Pareto front being the most
                  relevant to the DM, outperforming in this regard the
                  state-of-the-art interactive evolutionary hybrids. Moreover,
                  we demonstrate that the performance of EMOSOR improves in
                  case the forms of a preference model used by the method and
                  the DM's value system align. Furthermore, we discuss how
                  vastly incorporation of different indicators based on the
                  stochastic acceptability indices influences the quality of
                  both the best constructed solution and an entire
                  population. Finally, we demonstrate that our novel
                  questioning strategies allow to reduce a number of
                  interactions with the DM until a high-quality solution is
                  constructed or, alternatively, to discover a better solution
                  after the same number of interactions.}

                  to the Decision Maker (DM). For this reason, CIEMO/D asks the
                  DM, at regular intervals, to compare pairs of solutions from
                  the current population and uses such preference information
                  to bias the evolutionary search. Unlike the existing
                  interactive evolutionary algorithms dealing with just a
                  single population, CIEMO/D co-evolves a pool of
                  subpopulations in a steady-state decomposition-based
                  evolutionary framework. The evolution of each subpopulation
                  is driven by the use of a different preference model. In this
                  way, the algorithm explores various regions in the objective
                  space, thus increasing the chances of finding DM's most
                  preferred solution. To improve the pace of the evolutionary
                  search, CIEMO/D allows for the migration of solutions between
                  different subpopulations. It also dynamically alters the
                  subpopulations' size based on compatibility between the
                  incorporated preference models and the decision examples
                  supplied by the DM. The extensive experimental evaluation
                  reveals that CIEMO/D can successfully adjust to different
                  DM's decision policies. We also compare CIEMO/D with selected
                  state-of-the-art interactive evolutionary hybrids that make
                  use of the DM's pairwise comparisons, demonstrating its high

                  demonstrations available for both task-specific and
                  task-agnostic approaches (i.e., with or without reference to
                  the specific design problem to be tackled). However, the
                  advantages of multi-objective approaches over
                  single-objective ones have not been clearly spelled out and
                  experimentally demonstrated. This paper fills this gap for
                  task-specific approaches: starting from well-known results in
                  multi-objective optimisation, we discuss how to tackle
                  commonly recognised problems in evolutionary robotics. In
                  particular, we show that multi-objective optimisation (i)
                  allows evolving a more varied set of behaviours by exploring
                  multiple trade-offs of the objectives to optimise, (ii)
                  supports the evolution of the desired behaviour through the
                  introduction of objectives as proxies, (iii) avoids the
                  premature convergence to local optima possibly introduced by
                  multi-component fitness functions, and (iv) solves the

  abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.}

  abstract =     {Interactive multiobjective optimization (IMO) aims at finding
                  the most preferred solution of a decision maker with the
                  guidance of his/her preferences which are provided
                  progressively. During the process, the decision maker can
                  adjust his/her preferences and explore only interested
                  regions of the search space. In recent decades, IMO has
                  gradually become a common interest of two distinct
                  communities, namely, the multiple criteria decision making
                  (MCDM) and the evolutionary multiobjective optimization
                  (EMO). The IMO methods developed by the MCDM community
                  usually use the mathematical programming methodology to
                  search for a single preferred Pareto optimal solution, while
                  those which are rooted in EMO often employ evolutionary
                  algorithms to generate a representative set of solutions in
                  the decision maker's preferred region. This paper aims to
                  give a review of IMO research from both MCDM and EMO
                  perspectives. Taking into account four classification
                  criteria including the interaction pattern, preference
                  information, preference model, and search engine (i.e.,
                  optimization algorithm), a taxonomy is established to
                  identify important IMO factors and differentiate various IMO
                  methods. According to the taxonomy, state-of-the-art IMO
                  methods are categorized and reviewed and the design ideas
                  behind them are summarized. A collection of important issues,
                  e.g., the burdens, cognitive biases and preference
                  inconsistency of decision makers, and the performance
                  measures and metrics for evaluating IMO methods, are
                  highlighted and discussed. Several promising directions
                  worthy of future research are also presented.},

  abstract     = {Many small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the UK use the
                  beta (Business Excellence Through Action) approach to the
                  EFQM Excellence Model to conduct business excellence
                  self-assessment, which is in essence a multiple criteria
                  decision analysis (MCDA) problem. This paper introduces a
                  decision support software package called Intelligent Decision
                  System (IDS) to implement the beta approach. It is
                  demonstrated in the paper that the IDS-beta package can
                  provide not only average scores but also the following
                  numerical results and graphical displays on: Distributed
                  assessment results to demonstrate the diversity of company
                  performances The performance range to cater for incomplete
                  assessment information Comparisons between current
                  performances and past performances, among different companies
                  among different action plans. Strengths and weaknesses The
                  IDS-beta package also provides a structured knowledge base to
                  help assessors to make judgements more objectively. The
                  knowledge base contains guidelines provided by the developers
                  of the beta approach, best practices gathered from research
                  on award winning organizations, evidence collected from
                  companies being assessed and comments provided by assessors
                  to record the reasons why a specific criterion is assessed to
                  a certain grade for a company. Four small UK companies, the
                  industry partners of the research project, have carried out
                  the preliminary self-assessment using the package. The
                  results and experience of the application are discussed at
                  the end of the paper.},

This capability is essential for successful operation in domains such as signal interpretation, real-time diagnosis and repair, and mobile robot control. What characterizes these domains is that it is not feasible (computationally) or desirable (economically) to compute the optimal answer. This article surveys the main control problems that arise when a system is composed of several anytime algorithms. These problems relate to optimal management of uncertainty and precision. After a brief introduction to anytime computation, I outline a wide range of existing solutions to the metalevel control problem and describe current work that is aimed at increasing the applicability of anytime computation.},

                  centers or railroad yards must contend with scheduling
                  preventive maintenance tasks to ensure critical equipment
                  remains available. The workforce that performs these tasks
                  are often high-paid, which means the task scheduling should
                  minimize worker idle time. Idle time can always be minimized
                  by reducing the workforce. However, all preventive
                  maintenance tasks should be completed as quickly as possible
                  to make equipment available. This means the completion time
                  should be also minimized. Unfortunately, a small workforce
                  cannot complete many maintenance tasks per hour. Hence, there
                  is a tradeoff: should the workforce be small to reduce idle
                  time or should it be large so more maintenance can be
                  performed each hour? A cost effective schedule should strike
                  some balance between a minimum schedule and a minimum size
                  workforce. This paper uses evolutionary algorithms to solve
                  this multiobjective problem. However, rather than conducting
                  a conventional dominance-based Pareto search, we introduce a
                  form of utility theory to find Pareto optimal solutions. The
                  advantage of this method is the user can target specific
                  subsets of the Pareto front by merely ranking a small set of
                  initial solutions. A large example problem is used to
                  demonstrate our method."
