%% READ THESE RULES FIRST BEFORE MODIFYING THIS FILE
%% 0. This file should not contain 'article' entries. Put them in articles.bib.
%% 1. Keep the entries sorted with respect to the key.
%% 2. Check that what you are adding has not been added already with a
%%    different key.
%% 3. 'author' and 'editor' fields should be taken from authors.bib.
%% 4. 'publishers', 'series' and 'institution' should be taken from abbrev.bib.
%% 5. 'InProceedings', 'InCollection' and 'InBook' should take cross-references
%%    from crossref.bib
%% 6. The 'alias' field is used when a repeated entry is found.
%%    Delete one and add its key as the alias field of the other.
%%    This helps to locate entries that have been renamed or deleted.
%% 7. Papers in proceedings published as books (e.g., LNCS) should use
%%    InCollection type.
%% 8. InBook should be used ONLY for books where chapters do not have titles.
%% 9. Since some bib-styles mandate title-case but others mandate sentence-case
%%    and converting from title-case to sentence-case is done automatically but
%%    the opposite cannot be done, then titles should preferably be in
%%    title-case like "Data Structures and Algorithms". If a word or a letter
%%    should always be in upper (or lower) case, then surround them with
%%    braces, like in "The {ACO} Book", or "The {Pareto} Front".
%%10. Braces can prevent kerning between letters, so it is in general
%%    preferable to enclose entire words and not just single letters in braces
%%    to protect them.
%%11. The fields 'pdf', 'supplement', and 'epub' can be used to point out to a
%%    preferred PDF filename, a url containing supplementary material and a url
%%    containing the document, respectively.  These fields will be ignored by
%%    most BibTeX styles (.bst files), but they can be used with custom styles
%%    to, for example, generate an HTML bibliography, a list of publications.
%%    See testbib.tex for an example.
%%12. If you wish to add an entry for supplementary material to another
%%    publication, please use a Misc entry with the same label as for the main
%%    publication adding -supp at the end. Example: the supplementary material
%%    entry for BezLopStu2012:ants would be BezLopStu2012:ants-supp.
%%    This keeps the entries together, making easier to keep them in sync.
%%13. Use the following abbreviations for months: jan, feb, mar, apr, may, jun,
%%    jul, aug, sep, oct, nov, dec. Some bibstyles will abbreviate the months,
%%    others may use numeric values and others will use the full name. Using
%%    the abbreviations allows this customization to be consistent.
%%14. biblatex warns if 'month' field contains more than one month.
%%    Use the 'date' field in that case.
%% Z. Some of the entries do not follow the above rules.
%%    Please help us to update them little by little.

                  variables, while changing many variables or optimizing a

  abstract     = {We consider an optimization scenario in which resources are
                  required in the evaluation process of candidate
                  solutions. The challenge we are focussing on is that certain
                  resources have to be committed to for some period of time
                  whenever they are used by an optimizer. This has the effect
                  that certain solutions may be temporarily non-evaluable
                  during the optimization. Previous analysis revealed that
                  evolutionary algorithms (EAs) can be effective against this
                  resourcing issue when augmented with static strategies for
                  dealing with non-evaluable solutions, such as repairing,
                  waiting, or penalty methods. Moreover, it is possible to
                  select a suitable strategy for resource-constrained problems
                  offline if the resourcing issue is known in advance. In this
                  paper we demonstrate that an EA that uses a reinforcement
                  learning (RL) agent, here Sarsa({$\lambda$}), to learn
                  offline when to switch between static strategies, can be more
                  effective than any of the static strategies themselves. We
                  also show that learning the same task as the RL agent but
                  online using an adaptive strategy selection method, here
                  D-MAB, is not as effective; nevertheless, online learning is
                  an alternative to static strategies.},

                  sub-populations and individuals pose a challenge to the

                  personalisation, an already critical supply chain is facing
                  additional demands added by the very sensitive nature of its
                  products. Nevertheless, studies concerned with the efficient
                  development and delivery of these products are scarce. Thus,
                  this paper presents the case of personalised medicine and the
                  challenges imposed by its mass delivery. We propose a

  abstract     = {Multi-objective optimisation problems involve finding
                  solutions with varying trade-offs between multiple and often
                  conflicting objectives. Ising machines are physical devices
                  that aim to find the absolute or approximate ground states of
                  an Ising model. To apply Ising machines to multi-objective
                  problems, a weighted sum objective function is used to
                  convert multi-objective into single-objective
                  problems. However, deriving scalarisation weights that
                  archives evenly distributed solutions across the Pareto front
                  is not trivial. Previous work has shown that adaptive weights
                  based on dichotomic search, and one based on averages of
                  previously explored weights can explore the Pareto front
                  quicker than uniformly generated weights. However, these
                  adaptive methods have only been applied to bi-objective
                  problems in the past. In this work, we extend the adaptive
                  method based on averages in two ways: (i) we extend the
                  adaptive method of deriving scalarisation weights for
                  problems with two or more objectives, and (ii) we use an
                  alternative measure of distance to improve performance. We
                  compare the proposed method with existing ones and show that
                  it leads to the best performance on multi-objective
                  Unconstrained Binary Quadratic Programming (mUBQP) instances
                  with 3 and 4 objectives and that it is competitive with the
                  best one for instances with 2 objectives.},

                  designed to solve problems represented in binary, quadratic
                  and unconstrained form. Combinatorial optimisation problems
                  are therefore often formulated as Quadratic Unconstrained
                  Binary Optimisation Problems (QUBO) to solve them with these
                  algorithms. Moreover, these QUBO solvers are often
                  implemented using specialised hardware to achieve enormous
                  speedups, e.g. Fujitsu's Digital Annealer (DA) and D-Wave's
                  Quantum Annealer. However, these are single-objective
                  solvers, while many real-world problems feature multiple
                  conflicting objectives. Thus, a common practice when using
                  these QUBO solvers is to scalarise such multi-objective
                  problems into a sequence of single-objective problems. Due to
                  design trade-offs of these solvers, formulating each
                  scalarisation may require more time than finding a local
                  optimum. We present the first attempt to extend the algorithm
                  supporting a commercial QUBO solver as a multi-objective
                  solver that is not based on scalarisation. The proposed
                  multi-objective DA algorithm is validated on the bi-objective
                  Quadratic Assignment Problem. We observe that algorithm
                  performance significantly depends on the archiving strategy
                  adopted, and that combining DA with non-scalarisation methods
                  to optimise multiple objectives outperforms the current
                  scalarised version of the DA in terms of final solution
                  quality.},

  abstract="Heuristic optimizers are an important tool in academia and industry, and their performance-optimizing configuration requires a significant amount of expertise. As the proper configuration of algorithms is a crucial aspect in the engineering of heuristic algorithms, a significant research effort has been dedicated over the last years towards moving this step to the computer and, thus, make it automatic. These research efforts go way beyond tuning only numerical parameters of already fully defined algorithms, but exploit automatic configuration as a means for automatic algorithm design. In this chapter, we review two main aspects where the research on automatic configuration and multi-objective optimization intersect. The first is the automatic configuration of multi-objective optimizers, where we discuss means and specific approaches. In addition, we detail a case study that shows how these approaches can be used to design new, high-performing multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. The second aspect is the research on multi-objective configuration, that is, the possibility of using multiple performance metrics for the evaluation of algorithm configurations. We highlight some few examples in this direction.",

                  typically conflicting objectives. Often, it is very difficult
                  to weigh the different criteria exactly before alternatives
                  are known. Evolutionary multi-objective optimization usually
                  solves this predicament by searching for the whole
                  Pareto-optimal front of solutions. However, often the user
                  has at least a vague idea about what kind of solutions might
                  be preferred. In this chapter, we argue that such knowledge
                  should be used to focus the search on the most interesting
                  (from a user's perspective) areas of the Paretooptimal
                  front. To this end, we present and compare two methods which
                  allow to integrate vague user preferences into evolutionary
                  multi-objective algorithms. As we show, such methods may
                  speed up the search and yield a more fine-grained selection
                  of alternatives in the most relevant parts of the
                  Pareto-optimal front.},

                  improve efficiency, environmental care, and safety, since the
                  traffic jams and congestion are one of the biggest sources of
                  pollution and noise. Traffic lights play an important role in
                  solving these problems since they control the flow of the
                  vehicular network at the city. However, the increasing number
                  of vehicles makes necessary to go from a local control at one
                  single intersection to a holistic approach considering a
                  large urban area, only possible using advanced computational
                  resources and techniques. Here we propose HITUL, a system
                  that supports the decisions of the traffic control managers
                  in a large urban area. HITUL takes the real traffic
                  conditions and compute optimal traffic lights plans using
                  bio-inspired techniques and micro-simulations. We compare our
                  system against plans provided by experts. Our solutions not
                  only enable continuous traffic flows but reduce the
                  pollution. A case study of M{\'a}laga city allows us to

                  multiobjective optimization algorithms (EMOAs) have recently

                  theory of interactive EMOAs are made by deriving bounds on
                  the expected number of function evaluations and queries to a
                  decision maker. We analyze randomized local search and the
                  (1+1)-EA on the biobjective problems LOTZ and COCZ under the
                  scenario that the decision maker interacts with these
                  algorithms by providing a subjective preference whenever
                  solutions are incomparable. It is assumed that this decision
                  is based on the decision maker's internal utility
                  function. We show that the performance of the interactive
                  EMOAs may dramatically worsen if the utility function is
                  non-linear instead of linear.}

                  learning to cope with high-dimensional spaces. Also in the
                  case of high-dimensional multiobjective optimization
                  problems, a reduction of the objective space can be
                  beneficial both for search and decision making. New questions
                  arise in this context, e.g., how to select a subset of
                  objectives while preserving most of the problem structure. In
                  this chapter, two different approaches to the task of

                  explicit conflicts, the other based on principal component

                  objectives). However, it is known that problems with a high
                  number of objectives cause additional difficulties in terms
                  of the quality of the Pareto set approximation and running
                  time. Furthermore, the decision making process becomes the
                  harder the more objectives are involved. In this context, the
                  question arises whether all objectives are necessary to
                  preserve the problem characteristics. One may also ask under
                  which conditions such an objective reduction is feasible, and
                  how a minimum set of objectives can be computed. In this
                  paper, we propose a general mathematical framework, suited to
                  answer these three questions, and corresponding algorithms,
                  exact and heuristic ones. The heuristic variants are geared
                  towards direct integration into the evolutionary search
                  process. Moreover, extensive experiments for four well-known
                  test problems show that substantial dimensionality reductions
                  are possible on the basis of the proposed methodology.",

                  problem strongly influences both the performance of
                  generating methods and the decision making process in
                  general. On the one hand, with more objectives, more
                  incomparable solutions can arise, the number of which affects
                  the generating method's performance. On the other hand, the
                  more objectives are involved the more complex is the choice
                  of an appropriate solution for a (human) decision maker. In
                  this context, the question arises whether all objectives are
                  actually necessary and whether some of the objectives may be
                  omitted; this question in turn is closely linked to the
                  fundamental issue of conflicting and non-conflicting
                  optimization criteria. Besides a general definition of
                  conflicts between objective sets, we here introduce the
                  NP-hard problem of computing a minimum subset of objectives
                  without losing information (MOSS). Furthermore, we present
                  for MOSS both an approximation algorithm with optimum
                  approximation ratio and an exact algorithm which works well
                  for small input instances. We conclude with experimental
                  results for a random problem and the multiobjective

                  them as maximum likelihood estimators; given votes that are
                  seen as noisy estimates of a true ranking of the
                  alternatives, the rule must reconstruct the most likely true
                  ranking. We argue that this is too stringent a requirement,
                  and instead ask: How many votes does a voting rule need to
                  reconstruct the true ranking? We define the family of
                  pairwise-majority consistent rules, and show that for all
                  rules in this family the number of samples required from the
                  Mallows noise model is logarithmic in the number of
                  alternatives, and that no rule can do asymptotically better
                  (while some rules like plurality do much worse). Taking a
                  more normative point of view, we consider voting rules that
                  surely return the true ranking as the number of samples tends
                  to infinity (we call this property accuracy in the limit);
                  this allows us to move to a higher level of abstraction. We
                  study families of noise models that are parametrized by
                  distance functions, and find voting rules that are accurate
                  in the limit for all noise models in such general
                  families. We characterize the distance functions that induce
                  noise models for which pairwise-majority consistent rules are
                  accurate in the limit, and provide a similar result for
                  another novel family of position-dominance consistent
                  rules. These characterizations capture three well-known
                  distance functions.},

  title =        "Hybridization of Racing Methods with Evolutionary Operators
                  for Simulation Optimization of Traffic Lights Programs",
  abstract =     "In many real-world optimization problems, like the traffic
                  light scheduling problem tackled here, the evaluation of
                  candidate solutions requires the simulation of a process
                  under various scenarios. Thus, good solutions should not only
                  achieve good objective function values, but they must be
                  robust (low variance) across all different scenarios.
                  Previous work has revealed the effectiveness of IRACE for
                  this task.  However, the operators used by IRACE to generate
                  new solutions were designed for configuring algorithmic
                  parameters, that have various data types (categorical,
                  numerical, etc.). Meanwhile, evolutionary algorithms have
                  powerful operators for numerical optimization, which could
                  help to sample new solutions from the best ones found in the
                  search. Therefore, in this work, we propose a hybridization
                  of the elitist iterated racing mechanism of IRACE with
                  evolutionary operators from differential evo- lution and
                  genetic algorithms. We consider a realistic case study
                  derived from the traffic network of Malaga (Spain) with 275
                  traffic lights that should be scheduled optimally. After a
                  meticulous study, we discovered that the hybrid algorithm
                  comprising IRACE plus differential evolution offers
                  statistically better results than conventional algorithms and
                  also improves travel times and reduces pollution.",

  abstract     = {Modern high-performing algorithms are usually highly
                  parameterised, and can be configured either manually or by an
                  automatic algorithm configurator. The algorithm performance
                  dataset obtained after the configuration step can be used to
                  gain insights into how different algorithm parameters
                  influence algorithm performance. This can be done by a number
                  of analysis methods that exploit the idea of learning
                  prediction models from an algorithm performance dataset and
                  then using them for the data analysis on the importance of
                  variables. In this paper, we demonstrate the complementary
                  usage of three methods along this line, namely forward
                  selection, fANOVA and ablation analysis with surrogates on
                  three case studies, each of which represents some special
                  situations that the analyses can fall into. By these
                  examples, we illustrate how to interpret analysis results and
                  discuss the advantage of combining different analysis
                  methods.},

  author =       Deb,
  abstract =     {In its current state, evolutionary multiobjective
                  optimization (EMO) is an established field of research and
                  application with more than 150 PhD theses, more than ten
                  dedicated texts and edited books, commercial softwares and
                  numerous freely downloadable codes, a biannual conference
                  series running successfully since 2001, special sessions and
                  workshops held at all major evolutionary computing
                  conferences, and full-time researchers from universities and
                  industries from all around the globe. In this chapter, we
                  provide a brief introduction to EMO principles, illustrate
                  some EMO algorithms with simulated results, and outline the
                  current research and application potential of EMO. For
                  solving multiobjective optimization problems, EMO procedures
                  attempt to find a set of well-distributed Pareto-optimal
                  points, so that an idea of the extent and shape of the
                  Pareto-optimal front can be obtained. Although this task was
                  the early motivation of EMO research, EMO principles are now
                  being found to be useful in various other problem solving
                  tasks, enabling one to treat problems naturally as they
                  are. One of the major current research thrusts is to combine
                  EMO procedures with other multiple criterion decision making
                  (MCDM)  tools so as to develop hybrid and interactive
                  multiobjective optimization algorithms for finding a set of
                  trade-off optimal solutions and then choose a preferred
                  solution for implementation. This chapter provides the
                  background of EMO principles and their potential to launch
                  such collaborative studies with MCDM researchers in the
                  coming years.},

                  attention in the optimization research community since its
                  first appearance in the mid-1990s. Regarding multi-objective
                  optimization, a considerable number of algorithms based on
                  Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimizers (MOPSOs) can be
                  found in the specialized literature. Unfortunately, no
                  experimental comparisons have been made in order to clarify
                  which MOPSO version shows the best performance. In this
                  paper, we use a benchmark composed of three well-known
                  problem families (ZDT, DTLZ, and WFG) with the aim of
                  analyzing the search capabilities of six representative
                  state-of-the-art MOPSOs, namely, NSPSO, SigmaMOPSO, OMOPSO,
                  AMOPSO, MOPSOpd, and CLMOPSO. We additionally propose a new
                  MOPSO algorithm, called SMPSO, characterized by including a
                  velocity constraint mechanism, obtaining promising results
                  where the rest perform inadequately.",

  abstract =     {Many real-world optimization problems can be
                  modelled as combinatorial optimization
                  problems. Often, these problems are characterized by
                  their large size and the presence of multiple,
                  conflicting objectives. Despite progress in solving
                  multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems
                  exactly, the large size often means that heuristics
                  are required for their solution in acceptable time.
                  Since the middle of the nineties the trend is
                  towards heuristics that ``pick and choose'' elements
                  from several of the established metaheuristic
                  schemes. Such hybrid approximation techniques may
                  even combine exact and heuristic approaches. In this
                  chapter we give an overview over approximation
                  methods in multi-objective combinatorial
                  optimization. We briefly summarize ``classical''
                  metaheuristics and focus on recent approaches, where
                  metaheuristics are hybridized and/or combined with
                  exact methods.  },

  abstract =     {Given a finite set $Y \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ of n mutually
                  non-dominated vectors in $d \geq 2 dimensions$, the
                  hypervolume contribution of a point $y \in Y$ is the
                  difference between the hypervolume indicator of $Y$
                  and the hypervolume indicator of $Y \setminus \{y\}$. In
                  multi-objective metaheuristics, hypervolume
                  contributions are computed in several selection and
                  bounded-size archiving procedures. This paper
                  presents new results on the (time) complexity of
                  computing all hypervolume contributions. It is
                  proved that for $d = 2$ and 3 the problem has time
                  complexity $\Theta(n logn)$, and, for $d > 3$,
                  the time complexity is bounded below by $\Omega(n
                  logn)$. Moreover, complexity bounds are derived for
                  computing a single hypervolume contribution. A
                  dimension sweep algorithm with time complexity
                  $\mathcal{O} (n logn)$ and space
                  complexity $\mathcal{O}(n)$ is
                  proposed for computing all hypervolume contributions
                  in three dimensions. It improves the complexity of
                  the best known algorithm for $d = 3$ by a factor of
                  $\sqrt{n}$ . Theoretical results
                  are complemented by performance tests on randomly
                  generated test-problems.},

                  techniques based on the classical sequential methods and the
                  (l, r) search called Floating search algorithms are compared
                  against the Genetic approach to feature subset search. Both
                  approaches have been designed with the view to give a good

                  applicability of these techniques to high dimensional
                  problems of feature selection. The aim is to establish
                  whether the properties inferred for these techniques from
                  medium scale experiments involving up to a few tens of
                  dimensions extend to dimensionalities of one order of
                  magnitude higher. Further, relative merits of these
                  techniques vis-a-vis such high dimensional problems are
                  explored and the possibility of exploiting the best aspects
                  of these methods to create a composite feature selection
                  procedure with superior properties is considered.},

                  applications has led to an ever-growing demand for machine
                  learning systems that can be used off the shelf by
                  non-experts. To be effective in practice, such systems need
                  to automatically choose a good algorithm and feature
                  preprocessing steps for a new dataset at hand, and also set
                  their respective hyperparameters. Recent work has started to
                  tackle this automated machine learning (AutoML) problem with
                  the help of efficient Bayesian optimization methods. Building
                  on this, we introduce a robust new AutoML system based on the
                  Python machine learning package scikit-learn (using 15
                  classifiers, 14 feature preprocessing methods, and 4 data
                  preprocessing methods, giving rise to a structured hypothesis
                  space with 110 hyperparameters). This system, which we dub
                  Auto-sklearn, improves on existing AutoML methods by
                  automatically taking into account past performance on similar
                  datasets, and by constructing ensembles from the models
                  evaluated during the optimization. Our system won six out of
                  ten phases of the first ChaLearn AutoML challenge, and our
                  comprehensive analysis on over 100 diverse datasets shows
                  that it substantially outperforms the previous state of the
                  art in AutoML. We also demonstrate the performance gains due
                  to each of our contributions and derive insights into the
                  effectiveness of the individual components of Auto-sklearn.}

                  mutation rates. Following up on this line of work, we propose
                  a new mutation operator and analyze its performance on the
                  (1+1) Evolutionary Algorithm (EA). Our analyses show that
                  this mutation operator competes with pre-existing ones, when
                  used by the (1+1)-EA on classes of problems for which
                  results on the other mutation operators are available. We
                  present a ``jump'' function for which the performance of the
                  (1+1)-EA using any static uniform mutation and any restart
                  strategy can be worse than the performance of the (1+1)-EA
                  using our mutation operator with no restarts. We show that
                  the (1+1)-EA using our mutation operator finds a
                  (1/3)-approximation ratio on any non-negative submodular
                  function in polynomial time. This performance matches that of
                  combinatorial local search algorithms specifically designed
                  to solve this problem.",

                  of research today, with numerous real-world
                  applications. We describe {CLASS2.0}, a genetic
                  programming system for semi-automatically designing
                  {SAT} local search heuristics. An empirical
                  comparison shows that that the heuristics generated
                  by our {GP} system outperform the state of the art
                  human-designed local search algorithms, as well as
                  previously proposed evolutionary approaches, with
                  respect to both runtime as well as search efficiency
                  (number of variable flips to solve a problem).},

                  algorithm performance,learned during a separate
                  offline training sequence, which can be
                  prohibitively expensive. In recent work, we adopted
                  an online approach, in which models of the runtime
                  distributions of the available algorithms are
                  iteratively updated and used to guide the allocation
                  of computational resources, while solving a sequence
                  of problem instances. The models are estimated using
                  survival analysis techniques, which allow us to
                  reduce computation time, censoring the runtimes of
                  the slower algorithms. Here, we review the
                  statistical aspects of our online selection method,
                  discussing the bias induced in the runtime
                  distributions (RTD) models by the competition of
                  different algorithms on the same problem instances.},

                  for assessing the quality of the Pareto-front approximations
                  produced by multiobjective optimizers. It is shown that these
                  unary quality indicators are all, by definition, weighted
                  Hausdorff measures of the intersection of the region attained
                  by such an optimizer outcome in objective space with some
                  reference set. Moreover, when the optimizer is stochastic,
                  the indicators considered lead to real-valued random
                  variables following particular probability

                  experimentally on given problems by performing multiple
                  optimisation runs, and analysing the results. Since an
                  optimiser may be viewed as an estimator for the (Pareto)
                  minimum of a (vector) function, stochastic optimiser
                  performance is discussed in the light of the criteria
                  applicable to more usual statistical
                  estimators. Multiobjective optimisers are shown to deviate
                  considerably from standard point estimators, and to require
                  special statistical methodology. The attainment function is
                  formulated, and related results from random closed-set theory
                  are presented, which cast the attainment function as a
                  mean-like measure for the outcomes of multiobjective
                  optimisers. Finally, a covariance-measure is defined, which
                  should bring additional insight into the stochastic behaviour
                  of multiobjective optimisers. Computational issues and
                  directions for further work are discussed at the end of the

                  graph and the runtime distribution is uncovered. Performance
                  is investigated for different dimensions up to 40-D, for
                  different target precision values, and in different subgroups

  abstract =     {We investigate the problem of predicting variables of ordinal
                  scale. This task is referred to as ordinal regression and is
                  complementary to the standard machine learning tasks of
                  classification and metric regression. In contrast to
                  statistical models we present a distribution independent
                  formulation of the problem together with uniform bounds of
                  the risk functional. The approach presented is based on a
                  mapping from objects to scalar utility values. Similar to
                  support vector methods we derive a new learning algorithm for
                  the task of ordinal regression based on large margin rank
                  boundaries. We give experimental results for an information
                  retrieval task: learning the order of documents with respect
                  to an initial query. Experimental results indicate that the
                  presented algorithm outperforms more naive approaches to
                  ordinal regression such as support vector classification and
                  support vector regression in the case of more than two

                  operating effectively as a black box: providing a prediction
                  tool but no explanation of the underlying dynamics that drive
                  it. A common approach to interpretation is to plot the
                  dependence of a learned function on one or two predictors. We
                  present a method that seeks not to display the behavior of a
                  function, but to evaluate the importance of non-additive
                  interactions within any set of variables. Should the function
                  be close to a sum of low dimensional components, these
                  components can be viewed and even modeled
                  parametrically. Alternatively, the work here provides an
                  indication of where intrinsically high-dimensional behavior
                  takes place.The calculations used in this paper correspond
                  closely with the functional ANOVA decomposition; a
                  well-developed construction in Statistics. In particular, the
                  proposed score of interaction importance measures the loss
                  associated with the projection of the prediction function
                  onto a space of additive models. The algorithm runs in linear
                  time and we present displays of the output as a graphical
                  model of the function for interpretation purposes.},

                  problems expose free parameters, giving rise to combinatorial
                  spaces of possible configurations. Typically, these spaces
                  are hard for humans to understand. In this work, we study a
                  model-based approach for identifying a small set of both
                  algorithm parameters and instance features that suffices for
                  predicting empirical algorithm performance well. Our
                  empirical analyses on a wide variety of hard combinatorial
                  problem benchmarks spanning SAT, MIP, and TSP show that--for
                  parameter configurations sampled uniformly at random--very
                  good performance predictions can typically be obtained based
                  on just two key parameters, and that similarly, few instance
                  features and algorithm parameters suffice to predict the most
                  salient algorithm performance characteristics in the combined
                  configuration/feature space. We also use these models to
                  identify settings of these key parameters that are predicted
                  to achieve the best overall performance, both on average
                  across instances and in an instance-specific way. This serves
                  as a further way of evaluating model quality and also
                  provides a tool for further understanding the parameter
                  space. We provide software for carrying out this analysis on
                  arbitrary problem domains and hope that it will help
                  algorithm developers gain insights into the key parameters of
                  their algorithms, the key features of their instances, and

  abstract     = {Expensive black-box combinatorial optimization problems arise
                  in practice when the objective function is evaluated by means
                  of a simulator or a real-world experiment. Since each fitness
                  evaluation is expensive in terms of time or resources, only a
                  limited number of evaluations is possible, typically several
                  orders of magnitude smaller than in non-expensive
                  problems. In this scenario, classical optimization methods
                  such as mixed-integer programming and local search are not
                  useful.  In the continuous case, Bayesian optimization, in
                  particular using Gaussian processes, has proven very
                  effective under these conditions. Much less research is
                  available in the combinatorial case. In this paper, we
                  propose and analyze UMM, an estimation-of-distribution (EDA)
                  algorithm based on a Mallows probabilistic model and
                  unbalanced rank aggregation (uBorda). Experimental results on
                  black-box versions of LOP and PFSP show that UMM is able to
                  match, and sometimes surpass, the solutions obtained by CEGO,
                  a Bayesian optimization algorithm for combinatorial
                  optimization. Moreover, the computational complexity of UMM
                  increases linearly with both the number of function
                  evaluations and the permutation size.},

                  integrate an objective reduction technique into a
                  multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (moea) in order to
                  cope with many-objective problems. One scheme reduces
                  periodically the number objectives during the search until
                  the required objective subset size has been reached and,
                  towards the end of the search, the original objective set is
                  used again. The second approach is a more conservative scheme
                  that alternately uses the reduced and the entire set of
                  objectives to carry out the search. Besides improving
                  computational efficiency by removing some objectives, the
                  experimental results showed that both objective reduction
                  schemes also considerably improve the convergence of a moea
                  in many-objective problems.",

                  evaluation of non-safe input points, which are solutions,
                  policies, or strategies that cause an irrecoverable loss
                  (e.g., breakage of a machine or equipment, or life
                  threat). Although a comprehensive survey of safe
                  reinforcement learning algorithms was published in 2015, a
                  number of new algorithms have been proposed thereafter, and
                  related works in active learning and in optimization were not

                  of domains including reinforcement learning, Gaussian process
                  regression and classification, evolutionary computing, and
                  active learning. We provide the fundamental concepts on which

                  the violation of a constraint leads to an irrevocable loss,
                  such as breakage of a valuable experimental resource/platform
                  or loss of human life. Such problems are referred to as safe
                  optimization problems (SafeOPs). While SafeOPs have received
                  attention in the machine learning community in recent years,
                  there was little interest in the evolutionary computation
                  (EC) community despite some early attempts between 2009 and
                  2011. Moreover, there is a lack of acceptable guidelines on
                  how to benchmark different algorithms for SafeOPs, an area
                  where the EC community has significant experience in. Driven
                  by the need for more eficient algorithms and benchmark
                  guidelines for SafeOPs, the objective of this paper is to
                  reignite the interest of the EC community in this problem
                  class. To achieve this we (i) provide a formal definition of
                  SafeOPs and contrast it to other types of optimization
                  problems that the EC community is familiar with, (ii)
                  investigate the impact of key SafeOP parameters on the
                  performance of selected safe optimization algorithms, (iii)
                  benchmark EC against state-of-the-art safe optimization
                  algorithms from the machine learning community, and (iv)

                  is sometimes desirable to express performance in terms of the
                  quality attained in a certain fraction of sample runs. For
                  example, the sample median quality is the best estimator of
                  what one would expect to achieve in 50\% of runs, and
                  similarly for other quantiles. In multiobjective
                  optimization, the notion still applies but the outcome of a
                  run is measured not as a scalar (i.e. the cost of the best
                  solution), but as an attainment surface in $k$-dimensional
                  space (where $k$ is the number of objectives). In this paper
                  we report an algorithm that can be conveniently used to plot
                  summary attainment surfaces in any number of dimensions
                  (though it is particularly suited for three). A summary
                  attainment surface is defined as the union of all tightest
                  goals that have been attained (independently) in precisely
                  $s$ of the runs of a sample of $n$ runs, for any $s \in
                  1\ldots n$, and for any $k$. We also discuss the
                  computational complexity of the algorithm and give some
                  examples of its use. C code for the algorithm is available

                  of the issue is scalability to objective space dimension,
                  other things being equal. Here, we make some observations
                  about the efficiency of search in discrete spaces as a
                  function of the number of objectives, considering both
                  uncorrelated and correlated objective values. Efficiency is
                  expressed in terms of a cardinality-based
                  (scaling-independent) performance indicator. Considering
                  random sampling of the search space, we measure, empirically,
                  the fraction of the true PF covered after p iterations, as
                  the number of objectives grows, and for different
                  correlations. A general analytical expression for the
                  expected performance of random search is derived, and is
                  shown to agree with the empirical results. We postulate that
                  for even moderately large numbers of objectives, random
                  search will be competitive with an EMO algorithm and show
                  that this is the case empirically: on a function where each
                  objective is relatively easy for an EA to optimize (an
                  NK-landscape with K=2), random search compares favourably to
                  a well-known EMO algorithm when objective space dimension is
                  ten, for a range of inter-objective correlation values. The
                  analytical methods presented here may be useful for
                  benchmarking of other EMO algorithms.",

                  objectives are harder to optimize than problems with two or
                  three objectives. In this paper, we challenge this assumption
                  and provide empirical evidence that increasing the number of
                  objectives tends to reduce the difficulty of the landscape
                  being optimized. Of course, increasing the number of
                  objectives brings about other challenges, such as an increase
                  in the computational effort of many operations, or the memory
                  requirements for storing non-dominated solutions. More
                  precisely, we consider a broad range of multi- and
                  many-objective combinatorial benchmark problems, and we
                  measure how the number of objectives impacts the dominance
                  relation among solutions, the connectedness of the Pareto
                  set, and the landscape multimodality in terms of local
                  optimal solutions and sets. Our analysis shows the limit
                  behavior of various landscape features when adding more
                  objectives to a problem. Our conclusions do not contradict
                  previous observations about the inability of
                  Pareto-optimality to drive search, but we explain these
                  observations from a different perspective. Our findings have
                  important implications for the design and analysis of
                  many-objective optimization algorithms.}

                  local search for approximating the Pareto set of bi-objective
                  unconstrained binary quadratic programming problems. First,
                  we investigate two scalarizing strategies that iteratively
                  identify a high-quality solution for a sequence of
                  sub-problems. Each sub-problem is based on a static or
                  adaptive definition of weighted-sum aggregation coefficients,
                  and is addressed by means of a state-of-the-art
                  single-objective tabu search procedure. Next, we design a
                  Pareto local search that iteratively improves a set of
                  solutions based on a neighborhood structure and on the Pareto
                  dominance relation. At last, we hybridize both classes of
                  algorithms by combining a scalarizing and a Pareto local
                  search in a sequential way. A comprehensive experimental
                  analysis reveals the high performance of the proposed
                  approaches, which substantially improve upon previous
                  best-known solutions. Moreover, the obtained results show the
                  superiority of the hybrid algorithm over non-hybrid ones in
                  terms of solution quality, while requiring a competitive
                  computational cost. In addition, a number of structural
                  properties of the problem instances allow us to explain the
                  main difficulties that the different classes of local search
                  algorithms have to face.}

                  techniques used in analyzing and understanding the
                  performance of computer systems. Throughout the book, the
                  emphasis is on practical methods of measurement, simulation,
                  and analytical modeling. The author discusses performance
                  metrics and provides detailed coverage of the strategies used
                  in benchmark programmes. He gives intuitive explanations of
                  the key statistical tools needed to interpret measured
                  performance data. He also describes the general 'design of
                  experiments' technique, and shows how the maximum amount of
                  information can be obtained for the minimum effort. The book
                  closes with a chapter on the technique of queueing
                  analysis. Appendices listing common probability distributions
                  and statistical tables are included, along with a glossary of
                  important technical terms. This practically-oriented book
                  will be of great interest to anyone who wants a detailed, yet
                  intuitive, understanding of computer systems performance

  abstract     = {Inspired by the recent 11th Global Trajectory Optimisation
                  Competition, this paper presents the asteroid routing problem
                  (ARP) as a realistic benchmark of algorithms for expensive
                  bound-constrained black-box optimization in permutation
                  space. Given a set of asteroids' orbits and a departure
                  epoch, the goal of the ARP is to find the optimal sequence
                  for visiting the asteroids, starting from Earth's orbit, in
                  order to minimize both the cost, measured as the sum of the
                  magnitude of velocity changes required to complete the trip,
                  and the time, measured as the time elapsed from the departure
                  epoch until visiting the last asteroid. We provide
                  open-source code for generating instances of arbitrary sizes
                  and evaluating solutions to the problem.  As a preliminary
                  analysis, we compare the results of two methods for expensive
                  black-box optimization in permutation spaces, namely,
                  Combinatorial Efficient Global Optimization (CEGO), a
                  Bayesian optimizer based on Gaussian processes, and
                  Unbalanced Mallows Model (UMM), an estimation-of-distribution
                  algorithm based on probabilistic Mallows models. We
                  investigate the best permutation representation for each
                  algorithm, either rank-based or order-based. Moreover, we
                  analyze the effect of providing a good initial solution,
                  generated by a greedy nearest neighbor heuristic, on the
                  performance of the algorithms. The results suggest directions

  abstract =     {A key challenge, perhaps the central challenge, of
                  multi-objective optimization is how to deal with candidate
                  solutions that are ultimately evaluated by the hidden or
                  unknown preferences of a human decision maker (DM) who
                  understands and cares about the optimization problem.
                  Alternative ways of addressing this challenge exist but
                  perhaps the favoured one currently is the interactive
                  approach (proposed in various forms). Here, an evolutionary
                  multi-objective optimization algorithm (EMOA) is controlled
                  by a series of interactions with the DM so that preferences
                  can be elicited and the direction of search controlled. MCDM
                  has a key role to play in designing and evaluating these
                  approaches, particularly in testing them with real DMs, but
                  so far quantitative assessment of interactive EMOAs has been
                  limited.  In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework
                  for this problem of quantitative assessment, based on the
                  definition of machine decision makers (machine DMs), made
                  somewhat realistic by the incorporation of various
                  non-idealities. The machine DM proposed here draws from
                  earlier models of DM biases and inconsistencies in the MCDM
                  literature.  As a practical illustration of our approach, we
                  use the proposed machine DM to study the performance of an
                  interactive EMOA, and discuss how this framework could help
                  in the evaluation and development of better interactive
                  EMOAs.},

                  an approximation of the set of nondominated points
                  visited during a multiobjective optimization, a
                  problem commonly known as archiving. Most of the
                  currently available archiving algorithms are
                  reviewed, and what is known about their convergence
                  and approximation properties is summarized. The main
                  scenario considered is the restricted case where the
                  archive must be updated online as points are
                  generated one by one, and at most a fixed number of
                  points are to be stored in the archive at any one
                  time. In this scenario, the better-monotonicity of
                  an archiving algorithm is proposed as a weaker, but
                  more practical, property than negative efficiency
                  preservation. This paper shows that
                  hypervolume-based archivers and a recently proposed
                  multi-level grid archiver have this property. On the
                  other hand, the archiving methods used by SPEA2 and
                  NSGA-II do not, and they may better-deteriorate with
                  time. The better-monotonicity property has meaning
                  on any input sequence of points. We also classify
                  archivers according to limit properties,
                  i.e. convergence and approximation properties of the
                  archiver in the limit of infinite (input) samples
                  from a finite space with strictly positive
                  generation probabilities for all points. This paper
                  establishes a number of research questions, and
                  provides the initial framework and analysis for
                  answering them.},

                  combinatorial optimization problems are crucial for the
                  effectiveness of local search algorithms, particularly when
                  these algorithms are based on Pareto dominance. Such local
                  search algorithms typically return a set of mutually
                  nondominated Pareto local optimal (PLO) solutions, that is, a
                  PLO-set. This paper investigates two aspects of PLO-sets by
                  means of experiments with Pareto local search (PLS). First,
                  we examine the impact of several problem characteristics on
                  the properties of PLO-sets for multi-objective NK-landscapes
                  with correlated objectives. In particular, we report that
                  either increasing the number of objectives or decreasing the
                  correlation between objectives leads to an exponential
                  increment on the size of PLO-sets, whereas the variable
                  correlation has only a minor effect. Second, we study the
                  running time and the quality reached when using bounding
                  archiving methods to limit the size of the archive handled by
                  PLS, and thus, the maximum size of the PLO-set found. We
                  argue that there is a clear relationship between the running
                  time of PLS and the difficulty of a problem instance."

                  attainment surfaces and differences between the
                  first-order EAFs of the outcomes of two
                  algorithms. This visualization allows us to identify
                  certain algorithmic behaviors in a graphical way.
                  We explain the use of these visualization tools and
                  illustrate them with examples arising from
                  practice.},

                  colony optimization (ACO) algorithms have been
                  proposed for tackling multi-objective optimization
                  problems. In this paper, we propose a software
                  framework that allows to instantiate the most
                  prominent multi-objective ACO (MOACO)
                  algorithms. More importantly, the flexibility of
                  this MOACO framework allows the application of
                  automatic algorithm configuration techniques. The
                  experimental results presented in this paper show
                  that such an automatic configuration of MOACO
                  algorithms is highly desirable, given that our
                  automatically configured algorithms clearly
                  outperform the best performing MOACO algorithms that
                  have been proposed in the literature. As far as we
                  are aware, this paper is also the first to apply
                  automatic algorithm configuration techniques to
                  multi-objective stochastic local search algorithms.},

                  algorithms for tackling multiobjective combinatorial
                  optimization problems. These proposals adapt ACO
                  concepts in various ways, for example, some use
                  multiple pheromone matrices and multiple heuristic
                  matrices and others use multiple ant colonies.\\ In
                  this article, we carefully examine several of the
                  most prominent of these proposals. In particular, we
                  identify commonalities among the approaches by
                  recasting the original formulation of the algorithms
                  in different terms. For example, several proposals
                  described in terms of multiple colonies can be cast
                  equivalently using a single ant colony, where ants
                  use different weights for aggregating the pheromone
                  and/or the heuristic information. We study
                  algorithmic choices for the various proposals and we

                  high-speed solving of combinatorial optimization problems
                  mapped to an Ising model. With fully coupled bit connectivity
                  and high coupling resolution as a major feature, it can be
                  used to express a wide variety of combinatorial optimization
                  problems. The DA uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo as a basic
                  search mechanism, accelerated by the hardware implementation
                  of multiple speed-enhancement techniques such as parallel
                  search, escape from a local solution, and replica
                  exchange. It is currently being offered as a cloud service
                  using a second-generation chip operating on a scale of 8,192
                  bits. This paper presents an overview of the DA, its
                  performance against benchmarks, and application examples.}

                  plays an important part and the idea is to support
                  her/him in the search for the most preferred
                  solution. In interactive methods, steps of an
                  iterative solution algorithm are repeated and the
                  decision maker progressively provides preference
                  information so that the most preferred solution can
                  be found. We identify three types of specifying
                  preference information in interactive methods and
                  give some examples of methods representing each
                  type. The types are methods based on trade-off

                  chlorination stations, under unsteady

                  booster operation and design for a selected

                  valves, and the mass injection rates at each of the

                  chlorine injection stations, maximum allowable

                  returning at the end of the operational time horizon

                  timetabling and course timetabling
                  problems. Usually, these problems are characterized
                  by multiple conflicting objectives. A multiobjective
                  formalization of these problems is presented, based
                  on goals and priorities. Various aspects of
                  evolutionary algorithms are proposed and studied for
                  these problems, particulary, selection methods and
                  types and parameters of mutation operator. The
                  choice of both representation and operators is made
                  so as not to favour excessively certain objectives
                  with respect to others at the level of the
                  exploration mechanism. A comparative study of
                  performance is presented for the proposed algorithms
                  by means of statistical inference, based on real
                  problems of the University of Algarve. The notion of
                  attainment functions is used as a base for the
                  assessment of performance of multiobjective
                  evolutionary algorithms. Finally, the evolution of
                  the solution cost during the runs is analysed by
                  means of attainment functions, as well.}

                  of) a set of $n$ points in the positive $d$-orthant
                  has been proposed as an indicator of performance in
                  multiobjective optimization, known as the
                  hypervolume indicator, and the problem of computing
                  it efficiently is attracting increasing
                  attention. In this report, this problem is
                  formulated as a special case of Klee's measure
                  problem in $d$ dimensions, which immediately
                  establishes $O(n^{d/2}\log n)$ as a, possibly
                  conservative, upper bound on the required
                  computation time. Then, an $O(n log n)$ algorithm
                  for the 3-dimensional version of this special case
                  is constructed, based on an existing dimension-sweep
                  algorithm for the related maxima problem. Finally,
                  $O(n log n)$ is shown to remain a lower bound on the
                  time required by the hypervolume indicator for
                  $d>1$, which attests the optimality of the algorithm

                  with respect to overall performance. In this

                  settings of many search-based decision and optimization
                  algorithms. A recurrent, important step in software
                  development is the compilation of source code written in some
                  programming language into machine-executable code. The
                  generation of performance-optimized machine code itself is a
                  difficult task that can be parametrized in many different
                  possible ways. While modern compilers usually offer different
                  levels of optimization as possible defaults, they have a
                  larger number of other flags and numerical parameters that
                  impact properties of the generated machine-code. While the
                  generation of performance-optimized machine code has received
                  large attention and is dealt with in the research area of
                  auto-tuning, the usage of standard automatic algorithm
                  configuration software has not been explored, even though, as
                  we show in this article, the performance of the compiled code
                  has significant stochasticity, just as standard optimization
                  algorithms. As a practical case study, we consider the
                  configuration of the well-known GNU compiler collection (GCC)
                  for minimizing the run-time of machine code for various
                  heuristic search methods. Our experimental results show that,
                  depending on the specific code to be optimized, improvements
                  of up to 40{\%} of execution time when compared to the -O2
                  and -O3 optimization flags is possible.",

                  optimization problems (here arising from molecular discovery)
                  where costs are associated with the experiments (or
                  evaluations) to be carried out during the optimization
                  process. In the molecular discovery problem, candidate
                  compounds to be optimized must be synthesized in an iterative
                  process that starts from a set of purchasable items and
                  builds up to larger molecules. To produce target molecules,
                  their required resources are either used from
                  already-synthesized items in storage or produced themselves
                  on-demand at an additional cost. Any remaining resources from
                  the production process are stored for reuse for the next
                  evaluations. We model these resource dependencies with a
                  directed acyclic production graph describing the development
                  process from granular purchasable items to evaluable target
                  compounds. Moreover, we develop several resource-eficient
                  algorithms to address this problem. In particular, we develop
                  resource-aware variants of Random Search heuristics and of
                  Bayesian Optimization and analyze their performance in terms
                  of anytime behavior. The experimental results were obtained
                  from a real-world molecular optimization problem. Our results
                  suggest that algorithms that encourage exploitation by
                  reusing existing resources achieve satisfactory results while
                  using fewer resources overall.},

  abstract     = {Black-box optimization methods typically assume that
                  evaluations of the black-box objective function are equally
                  costly to evaluate. We investigate here a
                  resource-constrained setting where changes to certain
                  decision variables of the search space incur a higher
                  switching cost, e.g., due to expensive changes to the
                  experimental setup. In this scenario, there is a trade-off
                  between fixing the values of those costly variables or
                  accepting this additional cost to explore more of the search
                  space. We adapt two process-constrained batch algorithms to
                  this sequential problem formulation, and propose two new
                  methods: one one cost-aware and one cost-ignorant. We
                  validate and compare the algorithms using a set of 7 scalable
                  test functions with different switching-cost settings. Our
                  proposed cost-aware parameter-free algorithm yields
                  comparable results to tuned process-constrained algorithms in
                  all settings we considered, suggesting some degree of
                  robustness to varying landscape features and cost
                  trade-offs. This method starts to outperform the other
                  algorithms with increasing switching cost. Our work expands
                  on other recent Bayesian Optimization studies in
                  resource-constrained settings that consider a batch setting
                  only. Although the contributions of this work are relevant to
                  the general class of resource-constrained problems, they are
                  particularly relevant to problems where adaptability to
                  varying resource availability is of high importance.},

                  involves the combined analysis and exploration of a 2D

                  are projected, and a 2D configuration space, to which
                  (algorithm) configurations are projected. Extending on the
                  dimensionality reduction problem solved in Instance Space
                  Analysis, we define an optimisation problem for finding
                  projections to these two spaces, with an interpretable
                  relationship between them. Then, we describe the tools
                  developed for probing those spaces in an investigation of the
                  question: What characterises the algorithm configurations
                  that perform best on a selected group of instances (or vice

                  multiobjective optimization problems is that no explicit
                  formulation of the problem is available. Instead, a dataset
                  containing vectors of decision variables together with their
                  objective function value(s) is given and a surrogate model
                  (or metamodel) is build from the data and used for
                  optimization and decision-making. This data-driven
                  optimization process strongly depends on the ability of the
                  surrogate model to predict the objective value of decision
                  variables not present in the original dataset. Therefore, the
                  choice of surrogate modelling technique is crucial. While
                  many surrogate modelling techniques have been discussed in
                  the literature, there is no standard procedure that will
                  select the best technique for a given problem. In this work,
                  we propose the automatic selection of a surrogate modelling
                  technique based on exploratory landscape features of the
                  optimization problem that underlies the given dataset. The
                  overall idea is to learn offline from a large pool of
                  benchmark problems, on which we can evaluate a large number
                  of surrogate modelling techniques. When given a new dataset,
                  features are used to select the most appropriate surrogate
                  modelling technique. The preliminary experiments reported
                  here suggest that the proposed automatic selector is able to
                  identify high-accuracy surrogate models as long as an
                  appropriate classifier is used for selection."

                  that many real-world applications of multi-objective
                  optimization involve a large number (10 or more) of
                  objectives but then, existing evolutionary multi-objective
                  optimization (EMO) methods have primarily been applied to
                  problems having smaller number of objectives (5 or
                  less). After highlighting the major impediments in handling
                  large number of objectives, we proposed a principal component
                  analysis (PCA) based EMO procedure, for dimensionality
                  reduction, whose efficacy was demonstrated by solving upto
                  50-objective optimization problems. Here, we are addressing
                  the fact that, when the data points live on a non-linear
                  manifold or that the data structure is non-gaussian, PCA
                  which yields a smaller dimensional 'linear' subspace may be
                  ineffective in revealing the underlying dimensionality. To
                  overcome this, we propose two new non-linear dimensionality
                  reduction algorithms for evolutionary multi-objective
                  optimization, namely C-PCA-NSGA-II and MVU-PCA-NSGA-II. While
                  the former is based on the newly introduced correntropy PCA
                  [2], the later implements maximum variance unfolding
                  principle [3,4,5] in a novel way. We also establish the
                  superiority of these new EMO procedures over the earlier
                  PCA-based procedure, both in terms of accuracy and
                  computational time, by solving upto 50-objective optimization
                  problems.",

  abstract     = {Bayesian optimization has proven to be a highly effective
                  methodology for the global optimization of unknown, expensive
                  and multimodal functions.  The ability to accurately model
                  distributions over functions is critical to the effectiveness
                  of Bayesian optimization.  Although Gaussian processes
                  provide a flexible prior over functions, there are various
                  classes of functions that remain difficult to model.  One of
                  the most frequently occurring of these is the class of
                  non-stationary functions.  The optimization of the
                  hyperparameters of machine learning algorithms is a problem
                  domain in which parameters are often manually transformed a
                  priori, for example by optimizing in "log-space", to mitigate
                  the effects of spatially-varying length scale.  We develop a
                  methodology for automatically learning a wide family of
                  bijective transformations or warpings of the input space
                  using the Beta cumulative distribution function.  We further
                  extend the warping framework to multi-task Bayesian
                  optimization so that multiple tasks can be warped into a
                  jointly stationary space. On a set of challenging benchmark
                  optimization tasks, we observe that the inclusion of warping
                  greatly improves on the state-of-the-art, producing better
                  results faster and more reliably.}

  abstract =     "Operation of pumping stations represents high costs
                  to water supply companies. Therefore, reducing such
                  costs through an optimal pump scheduling becomes an
                  important issue. This work presents the use of
                  Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) to
                  solve an optimal pump-scheduling problem. For the
                  first time, six different approaches were
                  implemented and compared. These algorithms aim to
                  minimise four objectives: electric energy cost,
                  pumps' maintenance cost, maximum power peak, and
                  level variation in the reservoir. In order to
                  consider hydraulic and technical constrains, a
                  heuristic constrain algorithm was developed and
                  combined with each MOEA utilised. Evaluation of
                  experimental results of a set of metrics shows that
                  the Strength {Pareto} Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA)
                  achieves the best performance for this
                  problem. Moreover, SPEA's set of solutions provide
                  pumping station operation engineers with a wide
                  range of optimal pump schedules to chose from."

  abstract     = {We consider sequential decision problems under uncertainty,
                  where we seek to optimize an unknown function from noisy
                  samples. This requires balancing exploration (learning about
                  the objective) and exploitation (localizing the maximum), a
                  problem well-studied in the multi-armed bandit literature. In
                  many applications, however, we require that the sampled
                  function values exceed some prespecified "safety" threshold,
                  a requirement that existing algorithms fail to meet. Examples
                  include medical applications where patient comfort must be
                  guaranteed, recommender systems aiming to avoid user
                  dissatisfaction, and robotic control, where one seeks to
                  avoid controls causing physical harm to the platform. We
                  tackle this novel, yet rich, set of problems under the
                  assumption that the unknown function satisfies regularity
                  conditions expressed via a Gaussian process prior. We develop
                  an efficient algorithm called SafeOpt, and theoretically
                  guarantee its convergence to a natural notion of optimum
                  reachable under safety constraints. We evaluate SafeOpt on
                  synthetic data, as well as two real applications: movie
                  recommendation, and therapeutic spinal cord stimulation.},

                  IEMO/I, for interactive evolutionary multiple objective
                  optimization. During the optimization run, IEMO/I selects at
                  regular intervals a pair of solutions from the current
                  population to be compared by the Decision Maker. The
                  successively provided holistic judgements are employed to
                  divide the population into fronts of potential
                  optimality. These fronts are, in turn, used to bias the
                  evolutionary search toward a subset of Pareto-optimal
                  solutions being most relevant to the Decision Maker. To
                  ensure a fine approximation of such a subset, IEMO/I employs
                  a hypervolume metric within a steady-state indicator-based
                  evolutionary framework. The extensive experimental evaluation
                  involving a number of benchmark problems confirms that IEMO/I
                  is able to construct solutions being highly preferred by the
                  Decision Maker after a reasonable number of interactions. We

                  interactive evolutionary hybrids incorporating preference

                  selection wizards are complex and difficult to improve. We
                  propose in this work the use of automated configuration
                  methods for improving their performance by finding better
                  configurations of the algorithms that compose them. In
                  particular, we use elitist iterated racing (irace) to find
                  CMA configurations for specific artificial benchmarks that
                  replace the hand-crafted CMA configurations currently used in
                  the NGOpt wizard provided by the Nevergrad platform. We
                  discuss in detail the setup of irace for the purpose of
                  generating configurations that work well over the diverse set
                  of problem instances within each benchmark. Our approach
                  improves the performance of the NGOpt wizard, even on
                  benchmark suites that were not part of the tuning by irace.}

                  hyperparameter optimization methods are by now routinely used
                  in data mining. However, this progress is not yet matched by
                  equal progress on automatic analyses that yield information
                  beyond performance-optimizing hyperparameter settings. In
                  this work, we aim to answer the following two questions:
                  Given an algorithm, what are generally its most important
                  hyperparameters, and what are typically good values for
                  these? We present methodology and a framework to answer these
                  questions based on meta-learning across many datasets. We
                  apply this methodology using the experimental meta-data
                  available on OpenML to determine the most important
                  hyperparameters of support vector machines, random forests
                  and Adaboost, and to infer priors for all their
                  hyperparameters. The results, obtained fully automatically,
                  provide a quantitative basis to focus efforts in both manual
                  algorithm design and in automated hyperparameter
                  optimization. The conducted experiments confirm that the
                  hyperparameters selected by the proposed method are indeed
                  the most important ones and that the obtained priors also
                  lead to statistically significant improvements in
                  hyperparameter optimization.},

                  leads to inherently noisy performance measurements. Since
                  these measurements are often gathered once and then used
                  repeatedly, the number of collected samples will have a
                  significant impact on the reliability of algorithm
                  comparisons. We show that care should be taken when making
                  decisions based on limited data. Particularly, we show that
                  the number of runs used in many benchmarking studies, e.g.,
                  the default value of 15 suggested by the COCO environment,
                  can be insufficient to reliably rank algorithms on well-known
                  numerical optimization benchmarks.Additionally, methods for
                  automated algorithm configuration are sensitive to
                  insufficient sample sizes. This may result in the
                  configurator choosing a "lucky" but poor-performing
                  configuration despite exploring better ones. We show that
                  relying on mean performance values, as many configurators do,
                  can require a large number of runs to provide accurate
                  comparisons between the considered configurations. Common
                  statistical tests can greatly improve the situation in most
                  cases but not always. We show examples of performance losses
                  of more than 20\%, even when using statistical races to
                  dynamically adjust the number of runs, as done by irace. Our
                  results underline the importance of appropriately considering
                  the statistical distribution of performance values.},

                  optimize a safety-constrained Markov Decision
                  Process(MDP). In this setting, the agent must maximize
                  discounted cumulative reward while constraining the
                  probability of entering unsafe states, defined using a safety
                  function being within some tolerance. The safety values of
                  all states are not known a priori, and we probabilistically
                  model them via a Gaussian Process (GP) prior. As such,
                  properly behaving in such an environment requires balancing a
                  three-way trade-off of exploring the safety function,
                  exploring the reward function, and exploiting acquired
                  knowledge to maximize reward. We propose a novel approach to
                  balance this trade-off. Specifically, our approach explores
                  unvisited states selectively; that is, it prioritizes the
                  exploration of a state if visiting that state significantly
                  improves the knowledge on the achievable cumulative
                  reward. Our approach relies on a novel information gain
                  criterion based on Gaussian Process representations of the
                  reward and safety functions. We demonstrate the effectiveness
                  of our approach on a range of experiments, including a
                  simulation using the real Martian terrain data.},

  abstract =     "The Eternity II (EII) puzzle is a commercial edge matching
                  puzzle in which 256 square tiles with four coloured edges
                  must be arranged on a 16 by 16 grid such that all tile edges
                  are matched. In addition, a complete solution requires that
                  the `grey' patterns, which appear only on a subset of the
                  tiles, should be matched to the outer edges of the grid. The
                  puzzle belongs to the more general class of Edge Matching
                  Puzzles, which have been shown to be NP-complete. In July
                  2007, toy distributor Tomy UK Ltd. released this challenging
                  edge matching puzzle with a \$2 million prize. However, to
                  the best of our knowledge, no complete solution has ever been
                  found. Meanwhile, the final scrutiny date for the cash price,
                  31 December 2010, has passed, leaving the large money prize
                  unclaimed. In its 10 years of existence many people tried to
                  solve EII and some are still trying. Many approaches to Edge
                  Matching Puzzles are reported in the literature. Among these
                  approaches are constraint programming and backtracking,
                  metaheuristics, and evolutionary methods. Other approaches
                  translate the problem into SAT, MILP or max-clique and then
                  solve it with appropriate state of the art solvers. Some
                  approaches have also been implemented on parallel computing
                  or dedicated hardware."

                  data into a nonlinear feature space, we show how to discover
                  a mapping that "unfolds" the underlying manifold from which
                  the data was sampled. The kernel matrix is constructed by
                  maximizing the variance in feature space subject to local
                  constraints that preserve the angles and distances between
                  nearest neighbors. The main optimization involves an instance
                  of semidefinite programming---a fundamentally different
                  computation than previous algorithms for manifold learning,
                  such as Isomap and locally linear embedding. The optimized
                  kernels perform better than polynomial and Gaussian kernels
                  for problems in manifold learning, but worse for problems in
                  large margin classification. We explain these results in
                  terms of the geometric properties of different kernels and
                  comment on various interpretations of other manifold learning

                  Engine, namely MATE, where the parameters of an algorithm are
                  represented as expressions of the features of a target
                  optimisation problem. In contrast to most static
                  (feature-independent) algorithm tuning engines such as irace
                  and SPOT, our approach aims to derive the best parameter
                  configuration of a given algorithm for a specific problem,
                  exploiting the relationships between the algorithm parameters
                  and the features of the problem. We formulate the problem of
                  finding the relationships between the parameters and the
                  problem features as a symbolic regression problem and we use
                  genetic programming to extract these expressions in a
                  human-readable form. For the evaluation, we apply our
                  approach to the configuration of the (1 + 1) EA and RLS
                  algorithms for the OneMax, LeadingOnes, BinValue and Jump
                  optimisation problems, where the theoretically optimal
                  algorithm parameters to the problems are available as
                  functions of the features of the problems. Our study shows
                  that the found relationships typically comply with known
                  theoretical results---this demonstrates (1) the potential of
                  model-based parameter tuning as an alternative to existing
                  static algorithm tuning engines, and (2) its potential to
                  discover relationships between algorithm performance and
                  instance features in human-readable form.},

                  real-world applications. Some kriging parameters must be
                  estimated in order to reach a good accuracy in the
                  interpolation process, however, this task remains a
                  challenge. Various optimization methods have been tested to
                  find good parameters of the kriging process. In recent years,
                  many authors are using bio-inspired techniques and achieving
                  good results in estimating these parameters in comparison
                  with traditional techniques. This paper presents a comparison
                  between well known bio-inspired techniques such as Genetic
                  Algorithms and Particle Swarm Optimization in the estimation
                  of the essential kriging parameters: nugget, sill, range,
                  angle, and factor. In order to perform the tests, we proposed
                  a methodology based on the cluster-based kriging
                  method. Considering the Friedman test, the results showed no
                  statistical difference between the evaluated algorithms in
                  optimizing kriging parameters. On the other hand, the
                  Particle Swarm Optimization approach presented a faster
                  convergence, which is important in this high-cost
