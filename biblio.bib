                  is still a challenging task, in spite of increasing
                  computational power and faster algorithms. In this
                  paper a new approach combining an ant-based
                  algorithm with an exact solver for (mixed-integer)
                  linear programs is presented. A {MAX-MIN} ant system
                  is developed to determine the principal production
                  decisions, a {LP/MIP} solver is used to calculate
                  the corresponding production quantities and
                  inventory levels. Two different local search methods
                  and an improvement strategy based on reduced
                  mixed-integer problems are developed and integrated
                  into the ant algorithm. This hybrid approach
                  provides superior results for small and medium-sized
                  problems in comparison to the existing approaches in
                  the literature. For large-scale problems the
                  performance of this method is among the best.},

  abstract =     {Consider the following restricted (symmetric or
                  asymmetric) traveling-salesman problem {(TSP):}
                  given an initial ordering of the n cities and an
                  integer k {\textgreater} 0, find a minimum-cost
                  feasible tour, where a feasible tour is one in which
                  city i precedes city j whenever j [≥] i + k in the
                  initial ordering. Balas (1996) has proposed a
                  dynamic-programming algorithm that solves this
                  problem in time linear in n, though exponential in
                  k. Some important real-world problems are amenable
                  to this model or some of its close relatives. The
                  algorithm of Balas (1996) constructs a layered
                  network with a layer of nodes for each position in
                  the tour, such that source-sink paths in this
                  network are in one-to-one correspondence with tours
                  that satisfy the postulated precedence
                  constraints. In this paper we discuss an
                  implementation of the dynamic-programming algorithm
                  for the general case when the integer k is replaced
                  with city-specific integers k(j), j = 1, . . .,
                  n. We discuss applications to, and computational
                  experience with, {TSPs} with time windows, a model
                  frequently used in vehicle routing as well as in
                  scheduling with setup, release and delivery
                  times. We also introduce a new model, the {TSP} with
                  target times, applicable to {Just-in-Time}
                  scheduling problems. Finally for {TSPs} that have no
                  precedence restrictions, we use the algorithm as a
                  heuristic that finds in linear time a local optimum
                  over an exponential-size neighborhood. For this
                  case, we implement an iterated version of our
                  procedure, based on contracting some arcs of the
                  tour produced by a first application of the
                  algorithm, then reapplying the algorithm to the
                  shrunken graph with the same k.},

  abstract =     { The longest common subsequence problem is a
                  classical string problem that concerns finding the
                  common part of a set of strings. It has several
                  important applications, for example, pattern
                  recognition or computational biology. Most research
                  efforts up to now have focused on solving this
                  problem optimally. In comparison, only few works
                  exist dealing with heuristic approaches. In this
                  work we present a deterministic beam search
                  algorithm. The results show that our algorithm
                  outperforms the current state-of-the-art approaches
                  not only in solution quality but often also in
                  computation time.},

  abstract =     {Many real-world optimization problems can be
                  modelled as combinatorial optimization
                  problems. Often, these problems are characterized by
                  their large size and the presence of multiple,
                  conflicting objectives. Despite progress in solving
                  multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems
                  exactly, the large size often means that heuristics
                  are required for their solution in acceptable time.
                  Since the middle of the nineties the trend is
                  towards heuristics that “pick and choose” elements
                  from several of the established metaheuristic
                  schemes. Such hybrid approximation techniques may
                  even combine exact and heuristic approaches. In this
                  chapter we give an overview over approximation
                  methods in multi-objective combinatorial
                  optimization. We briefly summarize “classical”
                  metaheuristics and focus on recent approaches, where
                  metaheuristics are hybridized and/or combined with
                  exact methods.  },

                  defined as to determine the sequence of tasks to
                  satisfy the demand of customers who order several
                  types of products produced on a single machine. A
                  setup is required whenever a product type is
                  launched.  The objective of the scheduling problem
                  is to minimize the average customer order flow
                  time. Since the customer order scheduling problem is
                  known to be strongly {NP-hard,} we solve it using
                  four major metaheuristics and compare the
                  performance of these heuristics, namely, simulated
                  annealing, genetic algorithms, tabu search, and ant
                  colony optimization. These are selected to represent
                  various characteristics of metaheuristics:
                  nature-inspired vs. artificially created,
                  population-based vs. local search, etc. A set of
                  problems is generated to compare the solution
                  quality and computational efforts of these
                  heuristics.  Results of the experimentation show
                  that tabu search and ant colony perform better for
                  large problems whereas simulated annealing performs
                  best in small-size problems. Some conclusions are
                  also drawn on the interactions between various
                  problem parameters and the performance of the
                  heuristics.  },

  abstract =     "This paper deals with minimizing the total cost of
                  pumping in a liquid pipeline. Previous experience
                  with the most common solution procedures in pipeline
                  optimization is discussed along with their strengths
                  and weaknesses. The proposed method is an
                  evolutionary algorithm with two distinct features:
                  (1) The search is restricted to feasible region
                  only; and (2) it utilizes a floating point decision
                  variable rather than integer or binary as is the
                  case with most other similar approaches. A numerical
                  example is presented as a basis for verification of
                  the proposed method and its comparison with the
                  existing solver that utilizes the nonlinear
                  Newtonian search. The proposed method provides
                  promising improvements in terms of optimality when
                  compared to the widespread gradient search methods
                  because it does not involve evaluation of the
                  gradient of the objective function. It also provides
                  potential to improve the performance of previous
                  evolutionary programs because it restricts the
                  search to the feasible region, thus eliminating
                  large overhead associated with generation and
                  inspection of solutions that are
                  infeasible. Comparison of the two solutions revealed
                  improvement of the solution in favor of the proposed
                  algorithm, which ranged up to 6\% depending on the
                  initial values of the decision variables in the
                  Newtonian search. The proposed method was not
                  sensitive to the starting value of the decision
                  variables.",

                  part of the total operating cost for water-supply
                  networks. This study presents a method based on
                  linear programming for determining an optimal
                  (minimum cost) schedule of pumping on a 24-hr
                  basis. Both unit and maximum demand electricity
                  charges are considered. Account is taken of the
                  relative efficiencies of the available pumps, the
                  structure of the electricity tariff, the
                  consumer-demand profile, and the hydraulic
                  characteristics and operational constraints of the
                  network. The use of extended-period simulation of
                  the network operation in determining the parameters
                  of the linearized network equations and constraints
                  and in studying the optimized network operation is

                  existing network in the United Kingdom is presented,

  abstract =     { The team orienteering problem {(TOP)} involves
                  finding a set of paths from the starting point to
                  the ending point such that the total collected
                  reward received from visiting a subset of locations
                  is maximized and the length of each path is
                  restricted by a pre-specified limit. In this paper,
                  an ant colony optimization {(ACO)} approach is
                  proposed for the team orienteering problem. Four
                  methods, i.e., the sequential,
                  deterministic-concurrent and random-concurrent and
                  simultaneous methods, are proposed to construct
                  candidate solutions in the framework of {ACO.} We
                  compare these methods according to the results
                  obtained on well-known problems from the
                  literature. Finally, we compare the algorithm with
                  several existing algorithms. The results show that
                  our algorithm is promising.},

                  algorithm. The performance of the resulting hybrid
                  stochastic local search (SLS) algorithms is
                  experimentally investigated for the bi-objective
                  quadratic assignment problem (bQAP) and compared

                  local search algorithms for several

                  if the available computation time is not too limited

  abstract =     {Abstract In this work, we present a method, called
                  {Two-Phase} {P}areto Local Search, to find a good
                  approximation of the efficient set of the
                  biobjective traveling salesman problem. In the first
                  phase of the method, an initial population composed
                  of a good approximation of the extreme supported
                  efficient solutions is generated. We use as second
                  phase a {P}areto Local Search method applied to each
                  solution of the initial population. We show that
                  using the combination of these two techniques: good
                  initial population generation plus {P}areto Local
                  Search gives better results than state-of-the-art
                  algorithms. Two other points are introduced: the
                  notion of ideal set and a simple way to produce
                  near-efficient solutions of multiobjective problems,
                  by using an efficient single-objective solver with a
                  data perturbation technique.  },

                  is a partially discrete non-linear problem with many
                  variables. The scheduling method described in this
                  paper typically produces costs within 1\% of a
                  linear program-based solution, and can incorporate
                  realistic non-linear costs that may be hard to
                  incorporate in linear programming
                  formulations. These costs include pump switching and
                  maximum demand charges. A simplified model is
                  derived from a standard hydraulic simulator. An
                  initial schedule is produced by a descent
                  method. Two-stage simulated annealing then produces
                  solutions in a few minutes. Iterative recalibration
                  ensures that the solution agrees closely with the
                  results from a full hydraulic simulation.",

                  for solving nonlinear multiobjective optimization
                  problems. In interactive methods, a decision maker
                  plays an important part and the idea is to support
                  her/him in the search for the most preferred
                  solution. In interactive methods, steps of an
                  iterative solution algorithm are repeated and the
                  decision maker progressively provides preference
                  information so that the most preferred solution can
                  be found. We identify three types of specifying
                  preference information in interactive methods and
                  give some examples of methods representing each
                  type. The types are methods based on trade-off

                  colony optimization algorithm designed to solve the
                  problem of ordering cars on an assembly line
                  (car-sequencing problem). This problem has been
                  shown to be {NP-hard} and evokes a great deal of
                  interest among practitioners. Learning in an ant
                  algorithm is achieved by using an artificial
                  pheromone trail, which is a central element of this
                  metaheuristic. Many versions of the algorithm are
                  found in literature, the main distinction among them
                  being the management of the pheromone
                  trail. Nevertheless, few of them seek to perfect
                  learning by modifying the internal structure of the
                  trail. In this paper, a new pheromone trail
                  structure is proposed that is specifically adapted
                  to the type of constraints in the car-sequencing
                  problem. The quality of the results obtained when
                  solving three sets of benchmark problems is superior
                  to that of the best solutions found in literature
                  and shows the efficiency of the specialized trail.},

                  chlorination stations, under unsteady
                  hydraulics. The objective is to minimize the total
                  cost of operating the pumping units and the chlorine
                  booster operation and design for a selected
                  operational time horizon, while delivering the

                  decision variables, for each of the time steps that
                  encompass the total operational time horizon,
                  include: the scheduling of the pumping units,
                  settings of the water distribution system control
                  valves, and the mass injection rates at each of the
                  booster chlorination stations. The constraints are
                  domain heads and chlorine concentrations at the
                  consumer nodes, maximum injection rates at the
                  chlorine injection stations, maximum allowable

                  returning at the end of the operational time horizon

  ABSTRACT =     "The measure of the region dominated by (the maxima
                  of) a set of $n$ points in the positive $d$-orthant
                  has been proposed as an indicator of performance in
                  multiobjective optimization, known as the
                  hypervolume indicator, and the problem of computing
                  it efficiently is attracting increasing
                  attention. In this report, this problem is
                  formulated as a special case of Klee's measure
                  problem in $d$ dimensions, which immediately
                  establishes $O(n^{d/2}\log n)$ as a, possibly
                  conservative, upper bound on the required
                  computation time. Then, an $O(n log n)$ algorithm
                  for the 3-dimensional version of this special case
                  is constructed, based on an existing dimension-sweep
                  algorithm for the related maxima problem. Finally,
                  $O(n log n)$ is shown to remain a lower bound on the
                  time required by the hypervolume indicator for
                  $d>1$, which attests the optimality of the algorithm
                  proposed.",

                  (MCOPs) typically involve the selection and

                  role with respect to their overall performance and
                  relation to certain instance features is often not

                  in terms of {P}areto optimality and we present an
                  extensive analysis of SLS algorithms through
                  experimental design techniques, where each algorithm
                  component is considered a factor. The experimental
                  analysis is based on a sound experimental
                  methodology for analyzing the output of algorithms
                  for MCOPs. We show that different choices for
                  algorithm components can lead to different behavior

                  approach where we use ant colony optimization in
                  order to find a good lot-sizing sequence, i.e. a
                  sequence of the different items in the product
                  structure in which we apply a modified
                  {Wagner-Whitin} algorithm for each item
                  separately. Based on the setup costs each ant
                  generates a sequence of items. Afterwards a simple
                  single-stage lot-sizing rule is applied with
                  modified setup costs. This modification of the setup
                  costs depends on the position of the item in the
                  lot-sizing sequence, on the items which have been
                  lot-sized before, and on two further parameters,
                  which are tried to be improved by a systematic
                  search. For small-sized problems {ASMLLS} is among
                  the best algorithms, but for most medium- and
                  large-sized problems it outperforms all other

                  on all links is known as the capacitated minimum
                  spanning tree {(CMST)} problem. As the problem is
                  {NP-hard,} we propose a hybrid ant colony
                  optimization {(ACO)} algorithm to tackle it
                  heuristically. The algorithm exploits two important
                  problem characteristics: (i) the {CMST} problem is
                  closely related to the capacitated vehicle routing
                  problem {(CVRP),} and (ii) given a clustering of
                  client nodes that satisfies capacity constraints,
                  the solution is to find a {MST} for each cluster,
                  which can be done exactly in polynomial time. Our
                  {ACO} exploits these two characteristics of the
                  {CMST} by a solution construction originally
                  developed for the {CVRP.} Given the {CVRP} solution,
                  we then apply an implementation of Prim's algorithm
                  to each cluster to obtain a feasible {CMST}
                  solution. Results from a comprehensive computational
                  study indicate the efficiency and effectiveness of
                  the proposed approach.},

                  techniques for the multi-objective orienteering
                  problem are developed. The motivation stems from the
                  problem of planning individual tourist routes in a
                  city. Each point of interest in a city provides
                  different benefits for different categories (e.g.,
                  culture, shopping). Each tourist has different
                  preferences for the different categories when
                  selecting and visiting the points of interests
                  (e.g., museums, churches). Hence, a multi-objective
                  decision situation arises.  To determine all the
                  Pareto optimal solutions, two metaheuristic search
                  techniques are developed and applied. We use the
                  Pareto ant colony optimization algorithm and extend
                  the design of the variable neighborhood search
                  method to the multi-objective case. Both methods are
                  hybridized with path relinking procedures. The
                  performances of the two algorithms are tested on
                  several benchmark instances as well as on real world
                  instances from different Austrian regions and the
                  cities of Vienna and Padua.  The computational
                  results show that both implemented methods are well
                  performing algorithms to solve the multi-objective
                  orienteering problem.  },

                  to water supply companies. Therefore, reducing such
                  costs through an optimal pump scheduling becomes an
                  important issue. This work presents the use of
                  Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) to
                  solve an optimal pump-scheduling problem. For the
                  first time, six different approaches were
                  implemented and compared. These algorithms aim to
                  minimise four objectives: electric energy cost,
                  pumps' maintenance cost, maximum power peak, and
                  level variation in the reservoir. In order to
                  consider hydraulic and technical constrains, a
                  heuristic constrain algorithm was developed and
                  combined with each MOEA utilised. Evaluation of
                  experimental results of a set of metrics shows that
                  the Strength {P}areto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA)
                  achieves the best performance for this
                  problem. Moreover, SPEA's set of solutions provide
                  pumping station operation engineers with a wide
                  range of optimal pump schedules to chose from."

                  applying straightforward extensions of local search
                  algorithms for the single objective case. The
                  performance of the local search algorithms is
                  illustrated by experimental results obtained for
                  well known benchmark instances and comparisons to
                  methods from literature.  In fact, a 3-opt local
                  search is able to compete with the best performing
                  metaheuristics in terms of solution
                  quality. Finally, we also present an empirical study
                  of the features of the solutions found by 3-opt on a
                  set of randomly generated instances. The results
                  indicate the existence of several clusters of
                  near-optimal solutions that are separated by only a
                  few edges.},
