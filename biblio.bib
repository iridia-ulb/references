%% READ THESE RULES FIRST BEFORE MODIFYING THIS FILE
%% 1. Keep the entries sorted with respect to the key.
%% 2. Check that what you are adding has not been added already with a
%%    different key.
%% 3. 'author' and 'editor' fields should be taken from authors.bib.
%% 4. 'publishers', 'series' and 'institution' should be taken from abbrev.bib.
%% 5. 'journal' should be taken from journal.bib.
%% 6. 'InProceedings', 'InCollection' and 'InBook' should take cross-references
%%    from crossref.bib
%% 7. The 'alias' field is used when a repeated entry is found.
%%    Delete one and add its key as the alias field of the other.
%%    This helps to locate entries that have been renamed or deleted.
%% 8. Always use quotes "" instead of braces {} for the string definition.
%% 9. Articles in proceedings published as books (e.g., LNCS) should use
%%    InCollection type.
%%10. InBook should be used ONLY for books where chapters do not have titles.
%%11. Since some bib-styles mandate title-case but others mandate sentence-case
%%    and converting from title-case to sentence-case is done automatically but
%%    the opposite cannot be done, then titles should preferably be in
%%    title-case like "Data Structures and Algorithms". If a word or a letter
%%    should always be in upper (or lower) case, then surround them with
%%    braces, like in "The {ACO} Book", or "The {Pareto} Front".
%%12. Braces can prevent kerning between letters, so it is in general
%%    preferable to enclose entire words and not just single letters in braces
%%    to protect them.
%%13. The fields 'pdf' and 'supplement' can be used to point out to a preferred
%%    PDF filename and a url containing supplementary material respectively.
%%    These fields will be ignored by most BibTeX styles (.bst files), but
%%    they can be used with custom styles to, for example, generate an HTML
%%    bibliography, a list of publications. See testbib.tex for an example.
%%14. If you wish to add an entry for supplementary material to another
%%    publication, please use a Misc entry with the same label as for the main
%%    publication adding -supp at the end. Example: the supplementary material
%%    entry for BezLopStu2012:ants would be BezLopStu2012:ants-supp.
%%    This keeps the entries together, making easier to keep them in sync.
%%15. Use the following abbreviations for months: jan, feb, mar, apr, may, jun,
%%    jul, aug, sep, oct, nov, dec. Some bibstyles will abbreviate the months,
%%    others may use numeric values and others will use the full name. Using
%%    the abbreviations allows this customization to be consistent.
%%16. biblatex warns if 'month' field contains more than one month.
%%    Use the 'date' field in that case.
%% Z. Some of the entries do not follow the above rules.
%%    Please help us to update them little by little.

                  multiobjective optimization problems, because they allow a
                  decision-maker to provide her/his preference information
                  iteratively in a comfortable way at the same time as (s)he
                  learns about all different aspects of the problem. A wide
                  variety of interactive methods is nowadays available, and
                  they differ from each other in both technical aspects and
                  type of preference information employed. Therefore, assessing
                  the performance of interactive methods can help users to
                  choose the most appropriate one for a given problem. This is
                  a challenging task, which has been tackled from different
                  perspectives in the published literature. We present a
                  bibliographic survey of papers where interactive
                  multiobjective optimization methods have been assessed
                  (either individually or compared to other methods). Besides
                  other features, we collect information about the type of
                  decision-maker involved (utility or value functions,
                  artificial or human decision-maker), the type of preference
                  information provided, and aspects of interactive methods that
                  were somehow measured. Based on the survey and on our own
                  experiences, we identify a series of desirable properties of
                  interactive methods that we believe should be assessed.},

                  is still a challenging task, in spite of increasing
                  computational power and faster algorithms. In this
                  paper a new approach combining an ant-based
                  algorithm with an exact solver for (mixed-integer)
                  linear programs is presented. A {MAX-MIN} ant system
                  is developed to determine the principal production
                  decisions, a {LP/MIP} solver is used to calculate
                  the corresponding production quantities and
                  inventory levels. Two different local search methods
                  and an improvement strategy based on reduced
                  mixed-integer problems are developed and integrated
                  into the ant algorithm. This hybrid approach
                  provides superior results for small and medium-sized
                  problems in comparison to the existing approaches in
                  the literature. For large-scale problems the
                  performance of this method is among the best},

                  combinatorial optimization problems. Some instances of size

                  confidence bounds --- can be used to elegantly deal with
                  situations which exhibit an exploitation-exploration
                  trade-off. Our technique for designing and analyzing
                  algorithms for such situations is general and can be applied
                  when an algorithm has to make exploitation-versus-exploration
                  decisions based on uncertain information provided by a random
                  process.  We apply our technique to two models with such an
                  exploitation-exploration trade-off. For the adversarial
                  bandit problem with shifting our new algorithm suffers only
                  $O((ST)^{1/2})$ regret with high probability over $T$ trials
                  with $S$ shifts. Such a regret bound was previously known
                  only in expectation. The second model we consider is
                  associative reinforcement learning with linear value
                  functions. For this model our technique improves the regret
                  from $O(T^{3/4})$ to $O(T^{1/2})$."

                  sub-populations and individuals pose a challenge to the
                  traditional pharmaceutical industry. With a higher level of
                  personalisation, an already critical supply chain is facing
                  additional demands added by the very sensitive nature of its
                  products. Nevertheless, studies concerned with the efficient

  abstract =     {Consider the following restricted (symmetric or
                  asymmetric) traveling-salesman problem {(TSP):}
                  given an initial ordering of the n cities and an
                  integer $k > 0$, find a minimum-cost
                  feasible tour, where a feasible tour is one in which
                  city $i$ precedes city $j$ whenever $j >= i + k$ in the
                  initial ordering. Balas (1996) has proposed a
                  dynamic-programming algorithm that solves this
                  problem in time linear in n, though exponential in
                  k. Some important real-world problems are amenable
                  to this model or some of its close relatives. The
                  algorithm of Balas (1996) constructs a layered
                  network with a layer of nodes for each position in
                  the tour, such that source-sink paths in this
                  network are in one-to-one correspondence with tours
                  that satisfy the postulated precedence
                  constraints. In this paper we discuss an
                  implementation of the dynamic-programming algorithm
                  for the general case when the integer k is replaced
                  with city-specific integers k(j), j = 1, . . .,
                  n. We discuss applications to, and computational
                  experience with, {TSPs} with time windows, a model
                  frequently used in vehicle routing as well as in
                  scheduling with setup, release and delivery
                  times. We also introduce a new model, the {TSP} with
                  target times, applicable to {Just-in-Time}
                  scheduling problems. Finally for {TSPs} that have no
                  precedence restrictions, we use the algorithm as a
                  heuristic that finds in linear time a local optimum
                  over an exponential-size neighborhood. For this
                  case, we implement an iterated version of our
                  procedure, based on contracting some arcs of the
                  tour produced by a first application of the
                  algorithm, then reapplying the algorithm to the
                  shrunken graph with the same k.},

                  systems, which can be characterized as those systems for
                  which no model less complex than the system itself can
                  accurately predict in detail how the system will behave at
                  future times. Consequently, the standard tools of policy
                  analysis, based as they are on devising policies that perform
                  well on some best estimate model of the system, cannot be
                  reliably used for ABM. This paper argues that policy analysis
                  by using ABM requires an alternative approach to decision
                  theory. The general characteristics of such an approach are
                  described, and examples are provided of its application to

                  from one city or country to assess and strengthen the

                  momentum in disaster management and remain an important but
                  understudied topic in risk governance. Methodologies to
                  conduct a peer review are still in their infancy. To enhance
                  these, a systematic literature review (SLR) of academic and
                  non-academic literature was conducted on city resilience peer
                  reviews. Thirty-three attributes of resilience are
                  identified, which provides useful insights into how research
                  and practice can inform risk governance, and utilise peer
                  reviews, to drive meaningful change. Moreover, it situates
                  the challenges associated with resilience building tools
                  within risk governance to support the development of
                  interdisciplinary perspectives for integrated city resilience
                  frameworks. Results of this research have been used to
                  develop a peer review methodology and an international

  abstract =     {Grid search and manual search are the most widely
                  used strategies for hyper-parameter
                  optimization. This paper shows empirically and
                  theoretically that randomly chosen trials are more
                  efficient for hyper-parameter optimization than
                  trials on a grid. Empirical evidence comes from a
                  comparison with a large previous study that used
                  grid search and manual search to configure neural
                  networks and deep belief networks. Compared with
                  neural networks configured by a pure grid search, we
                  find that random search over the same domain is able
                  to find models that are as good or better within a
                  small fraction of the computation time. Granting
                  random search the same computational budget, random
                  search finds better models by effectively searching
                  a larger, less promising configuration
                  space. Compared with deep belief networks configured
                  by a thoughtful combination of manual search and
                  grid search, purely random search over the same
                  32-dimensional configuration space found
                  statistically equal performance on four of seven
                  data sets, and superior performance on one of
                  seven. A Gaussian process analysis of the function
                  from hyper-parameters to validation set performance
                  reveals that for most data sets only a few of the
                  hyper-parameters really matter, but that different
                  hyper-parameters are important on different data
                  sets. This phenomenon makes grid search a poor
                  choice for configuring algorithms for new data
                  sets. Our analysis casts some light on why recent
                  "High Throughput" methods achieve surprising
                  success: they appear to search through a large number
                  of hyper-parameters because most hyper-parameters do
                  not matter much. We anticipate that growing interest
                  in large hierarchical models will place an
                  increasing burden on techniques for hyper-parameter
                  optimization; this work shows that random search is
                  a natural baseline against which to judge progress
                  in the development of adaptive (sequential)
                  hyper-parameter optimization algorithms.},

  abstract =     {The goal of multi-objective optimization is to find
                  a set of best compromise solutions for typically
                  conflicting objectives. Due to the complex nature of
                  most real-life problems, only an approximation to
                  such an optimal set can be obtained within
                  reasonable (computing) time. To compare such
                  approximations, and thereby the performance of
                  multi-objective optimizers providing them, unary
                  quality measures are usually applied. Among these,
                  the \emph{hypervolume indicator} (or
                  \emph{S-metric}) is of particular relevance due to
                  its favorable properties. Moreover, this indicator
                  has been successfully integrated into stochastic
                  optimizers, such as evolutionary algorithms, where
                  it serves as a guidance criterion for finding good
                  approximations to the Pareto front. Recent results
                  show that computing the hypervolume indicator can be
                  seen as solving a specialized version of Klee's
                  Measure Problem.  In general, Klee's Measure Problem
                  can be solved with $\mathcal{O}(n \log n +
                  n^{d/2}\log n)$ comparisons for an input instance of
                  size $n$ in $d$ dimensions; as of this writing, it
                  is unknown whether a lower bound higher than
                  $\Omega(n \log n)$ can be proven. In this article,
                  we derive a lower bound of $\Omega(n\log n)$ for the
                  complexity of computing the hypervolume indicator in
                  any number of dimensions $d>1$ by reducing the
                  so-called \textsc{UniformGap} problem to it.  For
                  the three dimensional case, we also present a
                  matching upper bound of $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$
                  comparisons that is obtained by extending an
                  algorithm for finding the maxima of a point set.},

  abstract =     {Research on multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs)
                  has produced over the past decades a large number of
                  algorithms and a rich literature on performance assessment
                  tools to evaluate and compare them. Yet, newly proposed MOEAs
                  are typically compared against very few, often a decade older
                  MOEAs. One reason for this apparent contradiction is the lack
                  of a common baseline for comparison, with each subsequent
                  study often devising its own experimental scenario, slightly
                  different from other studies. As a result, the state of the
                  art in MOEAs is a disputed topic. This article reports a
                  systematic, comprehensive evaluation of a large number of
                  MOEAs that covers a wide range of experimental scenarios. A
                  novelty of this study is the separation between the
                  higher-level algorithmic components related to
                  multi-objective optimization (MO), which characterize each
                  particular MOEA, and the underlying parameters-such as
                  evolutionary operators, population size, etc.-whose
                  configuration may be tuned for each scenario. Instead of
                  relying on a common or "default" parameter configuration that
                  may be low-performing for particular MOEAs or scenarios and
                  unintentionally biased, we tune the parameters of each MOEA
                  for each scenario using automatic algorithm configuration
                  methods. Our results confirm some of the assumed knowledge in
                  the field, while at the same time they provide new insights
                  on the relative performance of MOEAs for many-objective
                  problems. For example, under certain conditions,
                  indicator-based MOEAs are more competitive for such problems
                  than previously assumed. We also analyze problem-specific
                  features affecting performance, the agreement between
                  performance metrics, and the improvement of tuned
                  configurations over the default configurations used in the
                  literature. Finally, the data produced is made publicly
                  available to motivate further analysis and a baseline for
                  future comparisons.}

                  number of MOEAs, underlying evolutionary algorithms, and
                  search paradigms that it comprises. These components can be
                  combined following a general MOEA template, and an automatic
                  configuration method is used to instantiate high-performing
                  MOEA designs that optimize a given performance metric and
                  present state-of-the-art performance. In the second part, we
                  propose a multiobjective formulation for the automatic MOEA
                  design, which proves critical for the context of
                  many-objective optimization due to the disagreement of
                  established performance metrics. Our proposed formulation
                  leads to an automatically designed MOEA that presents
                  state-of-the-art performance according to a set of metrics,
                  rather than a single one."

  abstract="Heuristic optimizers are an important tool in academia and industry, and their performance-optimizing configuration requires a significant amount of expertise. As the proper configuration of algorithms is a crucial aspect in the engineering of heuristic algorithms, a significant research effort has been dedicated over the last years towards moving this step to the computer and, thus, make it automatic. These research efforts go way beyond tuning only numerical parameters of already fully defined algorithms, but exploit automatic configuration as a means for automatic algorithm design. In this chapter, we review two main aspects where the research on automatic configuration and multi-objective optimization intersect. The first is the automatic configuration of multi-objective optimizers, where we discuss means and specific approaches. In addition, we detail a case study that shows how these approaches can be used to design new, high-performing multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. The second aspect is the research on multi-objective configuration, that is, the possibility of using multiple performance metrics for the evaluation of algorithm configurations. We highlight some few examples in this direction.",

  abstract =     {Multi-objective optimization algorithms aim at finding
                  Pareto-optimal solutions. Recovering Pareto fronts or Pareto
                  sets from a limited number of function evaluations are
                  challenging problems. A popular approach in the case of
                  expensive-to-evaluate functions is to appeal to
                  metamodels. Kriging has been shown efficient as a base for
                  sequential multi-objective optimization, notably through
                  infill sampling criteria balancing exploitation and
                  exploration such as the Expected Hypervolume
                  Improvement. Here we consider Kriging metamodels not only for
                  selecting new points, but as a tool for estimating the whole
                  Pareto front and quantifying how much uncertainty remains on
                  it at any stage of Kriging-based multi-objective optimization
                  algorithms. Our approach relies on the Gaussian process
                  interpretation of Kriging, and bases upon conditional
                  simulations. Using concepts from random set theory, we
                  propose to adapt the Vorob'ev expectation and deviation to
                  capture the variability of the set of non-dominated
                  points. Numerical experiments illustrate the potential of the
                  proposed workflow, and it is shown on examples how Gaussian
                  process simulations and the estimated Vorob'ev deviation can
                  be used to monitor the ability of Kriging-based
                  multi-objective optimization algorithms to accurately learn
                  the Pareto front.},

                  low-thrust (limited, at the moment, to single phase
                  trajectories), the inverse design of nano-structured
                  radiators and the design of non-reactive controllers for
                  planetary rovers. Featuring an arsenal of global and local
                  optimisation algorithms (including genetic algorithms,
                  differential evolution, simulated annealing, particle swarm
                  optimisation, compass search, improved harmony search, and
                  various interfaces to libraries for local optimisation such
                  as SNOPT, IPOPT, GSL and NLopt), PaGMO is at its core a C++
                  library which employs an object-oriented architecture
                  providing a clean and easily-extensible optimisation
                  framework. Adoption of multi-threaded programming ensures the
                  efficient exploitation of modern multi-core architectures and
                  allows for a straightforward implementation of the island
                  model paradigm, in which multiple populations of candidate
                  solutions asynchronously exchange information in order to
                  speed-up and improve the optimisation process. In addition to
                  the C++ interface, PaGMO's capabilities are exposed to the
                  high-level language Python, so that it is possible to easily
                  use PaGMO in an interactive session and take advantage of the
                  numerous scientific Python libraries available.}

                  problem that concerns finding the common part of a set of
                  strings. It has several important applications, for example,
                  pattern recognition or computational biology. Most research
                  efforts up to now have focused on solving this problem
                  optimally. In comparison, only few works exist dealing with
                  heuristic approaches. In this work we present a deterministic
                  beam search algorithm. The results show that our algorithm
                  outperforms the current state-of-the-art approaches not only
                  in solution quality but often also in computation time.},

                  assess the current state of the art and guide future research
                  and development. AI planning is no exception, and the
                  International Planning Competition (IPC) has been frequently
                  run for nearly two decades. Due to the organisational and
                  computational burden involved in running these competitions,
                  solvers are generally compared using a single homogeneous
                  hardware and software environment for all competitors. To
                  what extent does the specific choice of hardware and software
                  environment have an effect on solver performance, and is that
                  effect distributed equally across the competing solvers? In
                  this work, we use the competing planners and benchmark
                  instance sets from the 2014 IPC to investigate these two
                  questions. We recreate the 2014 IPC Optimal and Agile tracks
                  on two distinct hardware environments and eight distinct
                  software environments. We show that solver performance varies
                  significantly based on the hardware and software environment,
                  and that this variation is not equal for all
                  planners. Furthermore, the observed variation is sufficient
                  to change the competition rankings, including the top-ranked
                  planners for some tracks.},

                  algorithms for the resource-constrained project
                  scheduling problem ({RCPSP)} and its multiple mode
                  version ({MRCPSP).} The objective function
                  considered is minimisation of the makespan. The
                  conventional {SA} search scheme is replaced by a new
                  design that takes into account the specificity of
                  the solution space of project scheduling
                  problems. For {RCPSP}, the search was based on an
                  alternated activity and time incrementing process,
                  and all parameters were set after preliminary
                  statistical experiments done on test instances. For
                  {MRCPSP}, we introduced an original approach using
                  two embedded search loops alternating activity and
                  mode neighbourhood exploration. The performance
                  evaluation done on the benchmark instances available
                  in the literature proved the efficiency of both
                  adaptations that are currently among the most
                  competitive algorithms for these problems.},

  abstract =     "Urban traffic planning is a fertile area of Smart Cities to
                  improve efficiency, environmental care, and safety, since the
                  traffic jams and congestion are one of the biggest sources of
                  pollution and noise. Traffic lights play an important role in
                  solving these problems since they control the flow of the
                  vehicular network at the city. However, the increasing number
                  of vehicles makes necessary to go from a local control at one
                  single intersection to a holistic approach considering a
                  large urban area, only possible using advanced computational
                  resources and techniques. Here we propose HITUL, a system
                  that supports the decisions of the traffic control managers
                  in a large urban area. HITUL takes the real traffic
                  conditions and compute optimal traffic lights plans using
                  bio-inspired techniques and micro-simulations. We compare our
                  system against plans provided by experts. Our solutions not
                  only enable continuous traffic flows but reduce the
                  pollution. A case study of M{\'a}laga city allows us to
                  validate the approach and show its benefits for other cities

  abstract =     {Recently, there has been a large interest in set-based
                  evolutionary algorithms for multi objective
                  optimization. They are based on the definition of indicators
                  that characterize the quality of the current population while
                  being compliant with the concept of Pareto-optimality. It has
                  been shown that the hypervolume indicator, which measures the
                  dominated volume in the objective space, enables the design
                  of efficient search algorithms and, at the same time, opens
                  up opportunities to express user preferences in the search by
                  means of weight functions. The present paper contains the
                  necessary theoretical foundations and corresponding
                  algorithms to (i) select appropriate weight functions, to
                  (ii) transform user preferences into weight functions and to
                  (iii) efficiently evaluate the weighted hypervolume indicator
                  through Monte Carlo sampling. The algorithm W-HypE, which
                  implements the previous concepts, is introduced, and the
                  effectiveness of the search, directed towards the user's
                  preferred solutions, is shown using an extensive set of
                  experiments including the necessary statistical performance

                  multiobjective optimization algorithms (EMOAs) have recently
                  gained broad interest. In this study, first steps towards a
                  theory of interactive EMOAs are made by deriving bounds on
                  the expected number of function evaluations and queries to a
                  decision maker. We analyze randomized local search and the
                  (1+1)-EA on the biobjective problems LOTZ and COCZ under the
                  scenario that the decision maker interacts with these
                  algorithms by providing a subjective preference whenever
                  solutions are incomparable. It is assumed that this decision
                  is based on the decision maker's internal utility
                  function. We show that the performance of the interactive
                  EMOAs may dramatically worsen if the utility function is
                  non-linear instead of linear.}

                  statistics, pattern recognition, data mining, and machine
                  learning to cope with high-dimensional spaces. Also in the
                  case of high-dimensional multiobjective optimization
                  problems, a reduction of the objective space can be
                  beneficial both for search and decision making. New questions
                  arise in this context, e.g., how to select a subset of
                  objectives while preserving most of the problem structure. In
                  this chapter, two different approaches to the task of
                  objective reduction are developed, one based on assessing
                  explicit conflicts, the other based on principal component
                  analysis (PCA). Although both methods use different
                  principles and preserve different properties of the
                  underlying optimization problems, they can be effectively
                  utilized either in an a posteriori scenario or during
                  search. Here, we demonstrate the usability of the
                  conflict-based approach in a decision-making scenario after
                  the search and show how the principal-component-based
                  approach can be integrated into an evolutionary
                  multicriterion optimization (EMO) procedure.",

                  problem strongly influences both the performance of
                  generating methods and the decision making process in
                  general. On the one hand, with more objectives, more
                  incomparable solutions can arise, the number of which affects
                  the generating method's performance. On the other hand, the
                  more objectives are involved the more complex is the choice
                  of an appropriate solution for a (human) decision maker. In
                  this context, the question arises whether all objectives are
                  actually necessary and whether some of the objectives may be
                  omitted; this question in turn is closely linked to the
                  fundamental issue of conflicting and non-conflicting
                  optimization criteria. Besides a general definition of
                  conflicts between objective sets, we here introduce the
                  NP-hard problem of computing a minimum subset of objectives
                  without losing information (MOSS). Furthermore, we present
                  for MOSS both an approximation algorithm with optimum
                  approximation ratio and an exact algorithm which works well
                  for small input instances. We conclude with experimental
                  results for a random problem and the multiobjective
                  0/1-knapsack problem",

                  them as maximum likelihood estimators; given votes that are
                  seen as noisy estimates of a true ranking of the
                  alternatives, the rule must reconstruct the most likely true
                  ranking. We argue that this is too stringent a requirement,
                  and instead ask: How many votes does a voting rule need to
                  reconstruct the true ranking? We define the family of
                  pairwise-majority consistent rules, and show that for all
                  rules in this family the number of samples required from the
                  Mallows noise model is logarithmic in the number of
                  alternatives, and that no rule can do asymptotically better
                  (while some rules like plurality do much worse). Taking a
                  more normative point of view, we consider voting rules that
                  surely return the true ranking as the number of samples tends
                  to infinity (we call this property accuracy in the limit);
                  this allows us to move to a higher level of abstraction. We
                  study families of noise models that are parametrized by
                  distance functions, and find voting rules that are accurate
                  in the limit for all noise models in such general
                  families. We characterize the distance functions that induce
                  noise models for which pairwise-majority consistent rules are
                  accurate in the limit, and provide a similar result for
                  another novel family of position-dominance consistent
                  rules. These characterizations capture three well-known
                  distance functions.},

                  algorithm for the flowshop scheduling problem},
  abstract =     {The aim of this paper is two-fold. First, we introduce a
                  novel general estimation of distribution algorithm to deal
                  with permutation-based optimization problems. The algorithm
                  is based on the use of a probabilistic model for permutations
                  called the generalized Mallows model. In order to prove the
                  potential of the proposed algorithm, our second aim is to
                  solve the permutation flowshop scheduling problem. A hybrid
                  approach consisting of the new estimation of distribution
                  algorithm and a variable neighborhood search is
                  proposed. Conducted experiments demonstrate that the proposed
                  algorithm is able to outperform the state-of-the-art
                  approaches. Moreover, from the 220 benchmark instances
                  tested, the proposed hybrid approach obtains new best known
                  results in 152 cases. An in-depth study of the results
                  suggests that the successful performance of the introduced
                  approach is due to the ability of the generalized Mallows
                  estimation of distribution algorithm to discover promising
                  regions in the search space.},

                  estimate the set of inputs leading to a response exceeding a

                  not straightforward. Here we use notions from random set

                  a quantification of estimation uncertainty. We give explicit

  abstract =     "Evolutionary algorithms are widely used for solving
                  multiobjective optimization problems but are often criticized
                  because of a large number of function evaluations
                  needed. Approximations, especially function approximations,
                  also referred to as surrogates or metamodels are commonly
                  used in the literature to reduce the computation time. This
                  paper presents a survey of 45 different recent algorithms
                  proposed in the literature between 2008 and 2016 to handle
                  computationally expensive multiobjective optimization
                  problems. Several algorithms are discussed based on what kind
                  of an approximation such as problem, function or fitness
                  approximation they use. Most emphasis is given to function
                  approximation-based algorithms. We also compare these
                  algorithms based on different criteria such as metamodeling
                  technique and evolutionary algorithm used, type and
                  dimensions of the problem solved, handling constraints,
                  training time and the type of evolution control. Furthermore,
                  we identify and discuss some promising elements and major
                  issues among algorithms in the literature related to using an
                  approximation and numerical settings used. In addition, we
                  discuss selecting an algorithm to solve a given
                  computationally expensive multiobjective optimization problem
                  based on the dimensions in both objective and decision spaces

                  for Simulation Optimization of Traffic Lights Programs",
  abstract =     "In many real-world optimization problems, like the traffic
                  light scheduling problem tackled here, the evaluation of
                  candidate solu- tions requires the simulation of a process
                  under various scenarios. Thus, good solutions should not only
                  achieve good objective function values, but they must be
                  robust (low variance) across all different scenarios.
                  Previous work has revealed the effectiveness of IRACE for
                  this task.  However, the operators used by IRACE to generate
                  new solutions were designed for configuring algorithmic
                  parameters, that have various data types (categorical,
                  numerical, etc.). Meanwhile, evolutionary algorithms have
                  powerful operators for numerical optimization, which could
                  help to sample new solutions from the best ones found in the
                  search. Therefore, in this work, we propose a hybridization
                  of the elitist iterated racing mechanism of IRACE with
                  evolutionary operators from differential evo- lution and
                  genetic algorithms. We consider a realistic case study
                  derived from the traffic network of Malaga (Spain) with 275
                  traffic lights that should be scheduled optimally. After a
                  meticulous study, we discovered that the hybrid algorithm
                  comprising IRACE plus differential evolution offers
                  statistically better results than conventional algorithms and
                  also improves travel times and reduces pollution.",

  author =       Deb,
  abstract =     {In its current state, evolutionary multiobjective
                  optimization (EMO) is an established field of research and
                  application with more than 150 PhD theses, more than ten
                  dedicated texts and edited books, commercial softwares and
                  numerous freely downloadable codes, a biannual conference
                  series running successfully since 2001, special sessions and
                  workshops held at all major evolutionary computing
                  conferences, and full-time researchers from universities and
                  industries from all around the globe. In this chapter, we
                  provide a brief introduction to EMO principles, illustrate
                  some EMO algorithms with simulated results, and outline the
                  current research and application potential of EMO. For
                  solving multiobjective optimization problems, EMO procedures
                  attempt to find a set of well-distributed Pareto-optimal
                  points, so that an idea of the extent and shape of the
                  Pareto-optimal front can be obtained. Although this task was
                  the early motivation of EMO research, EMO principles are now
                  being found to be useful in various other problem solving
                  tasks, enabling one to treat problems naturally as they
                  are. One of the major current research thrusts is to combine
                  EMO procedures with other multiple criterion decision making
                  (MCDM)  tools so as to develop hybrid and interactive
                  multiobjective optimization algorithms for finding a set of
                  trade-off optimal solutions and then choose a preferred
                  solution for implementation. This chapter provides the
                  background of EMO principles and their potential to launch
                  such collaborative studies with MCDM researchers in the
                  coming years.},

                  Numerical Optimization},
  doi =          {10.1109/TEVC.2017.2776921},
  abstract =     {Solutions to most practical numerical optimization problems
                  must be evaluated for their performance over a number of
                  different loading or operating conditions, which we refer
                  here as scenarios. Therefore, a meaningful and resilient
                  optimal solution must be such that it remains feasible under
                  all scenarios and performs close to an individual optimal
                  solution corresponding to each scenario. Despite its
                  practical importance, multi-scenario consideration has
                  received a lukewarm attention, particularly in the context of
                  multi-objective optimization. The usual practice is to
                  optimize for the worst-case scenario. In this paper, we
                  review existing methodologies in this direction and set our
                  goal to suggest a new and potential population-based method
                  for handling multiple scenarios by defining scenario-wise
                  domination principle and scenario-wise diversity-preserving
                  operators. To evaluate, the proposed method is applied to a
                  number of numerical test problems and engineering design
                  problems with a detail explanation of the obtained results
                  and compared with an existing method. This first systematic
                  evolutionary based multi-scenario, multiobjective,
                  optimization study on numerical problems indicates that
                  multiple scenarios can be handled in an integrated manner
                  using an EMO framework to find a well-balanced compromise set
                  of solutions to multiple scenarios and maintain a tradeoff
                  among multiple objectives. In comparison to an existing
                  serial multiple optimization approach, the proposed approach
                  finds a set of compromised trade-off solutions
                  simultaneously. An achievement of multi-objective trade-off
                  and multi-scenario trade-off is algorithmically challenging,
                  but due to its practical appeal, further research and
                  application must be spent.},

  abstract =     "Automatic configuration (AC) methods are increasingly used to
                  tune and design optimisation algorithms for problems with
                  multiple objectives. Most AC methods use unary quality
                  indicators, which assign a single scalar value to an
                  approximation to the Pareto front, to compare the performance
                  of different optimisers. These quality indicators, however,
                  imply preferences beyond Pareto-optimality that may differ
                  from those of the decision maker (DM). Although it is
                  possible to incorporate DM's preferences into quality
                  indicators, e.g., by means of the weighted hypervolume
                  indicator (HV$^w$), expressing preferences in terms of weight
                  function is not always intuitive nor an easy task for a DM,
                  in particular, when comparing the stochastic outcomes of
                  several algorithm configurations. A more visual approach to
                  compare such outcomes is the visualisation of their empirical
                  attainment functions (EAFs) differences. This paper proposes
                  using such visualisations as a way of eliciting information
                  about regions of the objective space that are preferred by
                  the DM. We present a method to convert the information about
                  EAF differences into a HV$^w$ that will assign higher quality
                  values to approximation fronts that result in EAF differences
                  preferred by the DM. We show that the resulting HV$^w$ may be
                  used by an AC method to guide the configuration of
                  multi-objective optimisers according to the preferences of
                  the DM. We evaluate the proposed approach on a well-known
                  benchmark problem. Finally, we apply our approach to
                  re-configuring, according to different DM's preferences, a
                  multi-objective optimiser tackling a real-world production
                  planning problem arising in the manufacturing industry.",

                  proposed in the literature, for example, to explain approval

                  is subsumed by Falmagne and Regenwetter's size-independent
                  model, in the sense that every choice probability
                  distribution generated by the former can also be explained by
                  the latter. Our proof relies on the construction of a
                  probabilistic ranking model which we label the ``repeated
                  insertion model''. This model is a special case of Marden's
                  orthogonal contrast model class and, in turn, includes the
                  classical Mallows $\varphi$-model as a special case. We
                  explore its basic properties as well as its relationship to
                  Fligner and Verducci's multistage ranking model."

  abstract =     "Tuning controller parameters is a recurring and
                  time-consuming problem in control. This is especially true in
                  the field of adaptive control, where good performance is
                  typically only achieved after significant tuning. Recently,
                  it has been shown that constrained Bayesian optimization is a
                  promising approach to automate the tuning process without
                  risking system failures during the optimization
                  process. However, this approach is computationally too
                  expensive for tuning more than a couple of parameters. In
                  this paper, we provide a heuristic in order to efficiently
                  perform constrained Bayesian optimization in high-dimensional
                  parameter spaces by using an adaptive discretization based on
                  particle swarms. We apply the method to the tuning problem of
                  an L1 adaptive controller on a quadrotor vehicle and show
                  that we can reliably and automatically tune parameters in
                  experiments."

  abstract =     {Many real-world optimization problems can be
                  modelled as combinatorial optimization
                  problems. Often, these problems are characterized by
                  their large size and the presence of multiple,
                  conflicting objectives. Despite progress in solving
                  multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems
                  exactly, the large size often means that heuristics
                  are required for their solution in acceptable time.
                  Since the middle of the nineties the trend is
                  towards heuristics that ``pick and choose'' elements
                  from several of the established metaheuristic
                  schemes. Such hybrid approximation techniques may
                  even combine exact and heuristic approaches. In this
                  chapter we give an overview over approximation
                  methods in multi-objective combinatorial
                  optimization. We briefly summarize ``classical''
                  metaheuristics and focus on recent approaches, where
                  metaheuristics are hybridized and/or combined with
                  exact methods.  },

                  non-dominated vectors in $d \geq 2 dimensions$, the
                  hypervolume contribution of a point $y \in Y$ is the
                  difference between the hypervolume indicator of $Y$
                  and the hypervolume indicator of $Y \setminus \{y\}$. In
                  multi-objective metaheuristics, hypervolume
                  contributions are computed in several selection and
                  bounded-size archiving procedures. This paper
                  presents new results on the (time) complexity of
                  computing all hypervolume contributions. It is
                  proved that for d = 2,3 the problem has time
                  complexity $\Theta(n logn)$, and, for $d > 3$,
                  the time complexity is bounded below by $\Omega(n
                  logn)$. Moreover, complexity bounds are derived for
                  computing a single hypervolume contribution. A
                  dimension sweep algorithm with time complexity
                  $\mathcal{O} (n logn)$ and space
                  complexity $\mathcal{O}(n)$ is
                  proposed for computing all hypervolume contributions
                  in three dimensions. It improves the complexity of
                  the best known algorithm for d = 3 by a factor of
                  $\sqrt{n}$ . Theoretical results
                  are complemented by performance tests on randomly
                  generated test-problems.},

                  have not been verified directly. Of the hypothesized
                  problems, perhaps the most worrying is a worsening of
                  positive-outcome bias. A system that disfavours negative
                  results not only distorts the scientific literature directly,
                  but might also discourage high-risk projects and pressure
                  scientists to fabricate and falsify their data. This study
                  analysed over 4,600 papers published in all disciplines
                  between 1990 and 2007, measuring the frequency of papers
                  that, having declared to have ``tested'' a hypothesis,
                  reported a positive support for it. The overall frequency of
                  positive supports has grown by over 22{\%} between 1990 and
                  2007, with significant differences between disciplines and
                  countries. The increase was stronger in the social and some
                  biomedical disciplines. The United States had published, over
                  the years, significantly fewer positive results than Asian
                  countries (and particularly Japan) but more than European
                  countries (and in particular the United
                  Kingdom). Methodological artefacts cannot explain away these
                  patterns, which support the hypotheses that research is
                  becoming less pioneering and/or that the objectivity with
                  which results are produced and published is decreasing.",

  abstract =     { High sensitivity to initial conditions is generally viewed
                  as a drawback of tree search methods because it leads to
                  erratic behavior to be mitigated somehow. In this paper we
                  investigate the opposite viewpoint and consider this behavior
                  as an opportunity to exploit. Our working hypothesis is that
                  erraticism is in fact just a consequence of the exponential
                  nature of tree search that acts as a chaotic amplifier, so it
                  is largely unavoidable. We propose a bet-and-run approach to
                  actually turn erraticism to one's advantage. The idea is to
                  make a number of short sample runs with randomized initial
                  conditions, to bet on the "most promising" run selected
                  according to certain simple criteria, and to bring it to
                  completion. Computational results on a large testbed of mixed
                  integer linear programs from the literature are presented,
                  showing the potential of this approach even when embedded in
                  a proof-of-concept implementation. }

                  (Hypervolume by Slicing Objectives) algorithm by
                  pruning the recursion tree to avoid repeated
                  dominance checks and the recalculation of partial

                  result for the three-dimensional special case.  The
                  proposed algorithm achieves $O(n^{d-2} \log n)$ time

                  operator. Recently, much attention has been devoted to the
                  study of mutation operators with dynamic and non-uniform
                  mutation rates. Following up on this line of work, we propose
                  a new mutation operator and analyze its performance on the
                  (1+1) Evolutionary Algorithm (EA). Our analyses show that
                  this mutation operator competes with pre-existing ones, when
                  used by the (1+1)-EA on classes of problems for which
                  results on the other mutation operators are available. We
                  present a ``jump'' function for which the performance of the
                  (1+1)-EA using any static uniform mutation and any restart
                  strategy can be worse than the performance of the (1+1)-EA
                  using our mutation operator with no restarts. We show that
                  the (1+1)-EA using our mutation operator finds a
                  (1/3)-approximation ratio on any non-negative submodular
                  function in polynomial time. This performance matches that of
                  combinatorial local search algorithms specifically designed
                  to solve this problem.",

                  problem such as satisfiability testing ({SAT)} is a
                  challenging task. We investigate an evolutionary
                  approach to automating the discovery of new local
                  search heuristics for {SAT.} We show that several
                  well-known {SAT} local search algorithms such as
                  Walksat and Novelty are composite heuristics that
                  are derived from novel combinations of a set of
                  building blocks. Based on this observation, we
                  developed {CLASS}, a genetic programming system that
                  uses a simple composition operator to automatically
                  discover {SAT} local search heuristics. New
                  heuristics discovered by {CLASS} are shown to be
                  competitive with the best Walksat variants,
                  including Novelty+. Evolutionary algorithms have
                  previously been applied to directly evolve a
                  solution for a particular {SAT} instance. We show
                  that the heuristics discovered by {CLASS} are also
                  competitive with these previous, direct evolutionary
                  approaches for {SAT.} We also analyze the local
                  search behavior of the learned heuristics using the
                  depth, mobility, and coverage metrics proposed by
                  Schuurmans and Southey.},

                  prohibitively expensive. In recent work, we adopted
                  an online approach, in which models of the runtime
                  distributions of the available algorithms are
                  iteratively updated and used to guide the allocation
                  of computational resources, while solving a sequence
                  of problem instances. The models are estimated using
                  survival analysis techniques, which allow us to
                  reduce computation time, censoring the runtimes of
                  the slower algorithms. Here, we review the
                  statistical aspects of our online selection method,
                  discussing the bias induced in the runtime
                  distributions (RTD) models by the competition of
                  different algorithms on the same problem instances.},

  abstract =     {After growing up together, and mostly growing apart in the
                  second half of the 20th century, the fields of artificial
                  intelligence (AI), cognitive science, and neuroscience are
                  reconverging on a shared view of the computational
                  foundations of intelligence that promotes valuable
                  cross-disciplinary exchanges on questions, methods, and
                  results. We chart advances over the past several decades that
                  address challenges of perception and action under uncertainty
                  through the lens of computation. Advances include the
                  development of representations and inferential procedures for
                  large-scale probabilistic inference and machinery for
                  enabling reflection and decisions about tradeoffs in effort,
                  precision, and timeliness of computations. These tools are
                  deployed toward the goal of computational rationality:
                  identifying decisions with highest expected utility, while
                  taking into consideration the costs of computation in complex
                  real-world problems in which most relevant calculations can
                  only be approximated. We highlight key concepts with examples
                  that show the potential for interchange between computer
                  science, cognitive science, and neuroscience.},

                  ant colony optimization (ACO) approach applied to nurse
                  scheduling, analyzing a dynamic regional problem which is
                  currently under discussion at the Vienna hospital
                  compound. Each day, pool nurses have to be assigned for the
                  following days to public hospitals while taking into account
                  a variety of soft and hard constraints regarding working date
                  and time, working patterns, nurses qualifications, nurses
                  and hospitals preferences, as well as costs. Extensive
                  computational experiments based on a four week simulation
                  period were used to evaluate three different scenarios
                  varying the number of nurses and hospitals for six different
                  hospitals demand intensities. The results of our simulations
                  and optimizations reveal that the proposed {ACO} algorithm
                  achieves highly significant improvements compared to a greedy
                  assignment algorithm."

  abstract =     {The customer order scheduling problem {(COSP)} is defined as
                  to determine the sequence of tasks to satisfy the demand of
                  customers who order several types of products produced on a
                  single machine. A setup is required whenever a product type
                  is launched.  The objective of the scheduling problem is to
                  minimize the average customer order flow time. Since the
                  customer order scheduling problem is known to be strongly
                  {NP-hard,} we solve it using four major metaheuristics and
                  compare the performance of these heuristics, namely,
                  simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, tabu search, and ant
                  colony optimization. These are selected to represent various
                  characteristics of metaheuristics: nature-inspired
                  vs. artificially created, population-based vs. local search,
                  etc. A set of problems is generated to compare the solution
                  quality and computational efforts of these heuristics.
                  Results of the experimentation show that tabu search and ant
                  colony perform better for large problems whereas simulated
                  annealing performs best in small-size problems. Some
                  conclusions are also drawn on the interactions between
                  various problem parameters and the performance of the
                  heuristics.},

                  used to acquire difficult to solve combinatorial problem
                  instances. As a result of this technique, the corresponding
                  algorithms used to solve these instances are
                  stress-tested. The technique is applied in three important
                  domains of combinatorial optimisation, binary constraint
                  satisfaction, Boolean satisfiability, and the travelling
                  salesman problem. The problem instances acquired through this
                  technique are more difficult than the ones found in popular
                  benchmarks. In this paper, these evolved instances are
                  analysed with the aim to explain their difficulty in terms of
                  structural properties, thereby exposing the weaknesses of
                  corresponding algorithms. }

                  improves the simulation of a human decision-maker (DM) by
                  considering how resource constraints impact their evaluation
                  process in an interactive Goal Programming problem. Our
                  analysis confirms and emphasizes a previous simulation study
                  by showing key areas that could be effected by cognitive
                  mechanisms. While the results are promising, the effects
                  should be validated by future experiments with human DMs.",

  abstract =     "This paper deals with minimizing the total cost of
                  pumping in a liquid pipeline. Previous experience
                  with the most common solution procedures in pipeline
                  optimization is discussed along with their strengths
                  and weaknesses. The proposed method is an
                  evolutionary algorithm with two distinct features:
                  (1) The search is restricted to feasible region
                  only; and (2) it utilizes a floating point decision
                  variable rather than integer or binary as is the
                  case with most other similar approaches. A numerical
                  example is presented as a basis for verification of
                  the proposed method and its comparison with the
                  existing solver that utilizes the nonlinear
                  Newtonian search. The proposed method provides
                  promising improvements in terms of optimality when
                  compared to the widespread gradient search methods
                  because it does not involve evaluation of the
                  gradient of the objective function. It also provides
                  potential to improve the performance of previous
                  evolutionary programs because it restricts the
                  search to the feasible region, thus eliminating
                  large overhead associated with generation and
                  inspection of solutions that are
                  infeasible. Comparison of the two solutions revealed
                  improvement of the solution in favor of the proposed
                  algorithm, which ranged up to 6\% depending on the
                  initial values of the decision variables in the
                  Newtonian search. The proposed method was not
                  sensitive to the starting value of the decision
                  variables.",

  abstract =     "Expensive black-box combinatorial optimization problems arise
                  in practice when the objective function is evaluated by means
                  of a simulator or a real-world experiment. Since each fitness
                  evaluation is expensive in terms of time or resources, only a
                  limited number of evaluations is possible, typically several
                  orders of magnitude smaller than in non-expensive
                  problems. In this scenario, classical optimization methods
                  such as mixed-integer programming and local search are not
                  useful.  In the continuous case, Bayesian optimization, in
                  particular using Gaussian processes, has proven very
                  effective under these conditions. Much less research is
                  available in the combinatorial case. In this paper, we
                  propose and analyze UMM, an estimation-of-distribution (EDA)
                  algorithm based on a Mallows probabilistic model and
                  unbalanced rank aggregation (uBorda). Experimental results on
                  black-box versions of LOP and PFSP show that UMM is able to
                  match, and sometimes surpass, the solutions obtained by CEGO,
                  a Bayesian optimization algorithm for combinatorial
                  optimization. Moreover, the computational complexity of UMM
                  increases linearly with both the number of function
                  evaluations and the permutation size."

                  part of the total operating cost for water-supply
                  networks. This study presents a method based on
                  linear programming for determining an optimal
                  (minimum cost) schedule of pumping on a 24-hr
                  basis. Both unit and maximum demand electricity
                  charges are considered. Account is taken of the
                  relative efficiencies of the available pumps, the
                  structure of the electricity tariff, the
                  consumer-demand profile, and the hydraulic
                  characteristics and operational constraints of the
                  network. The use of extended-period simulation of
                  the network operation in determining the parameters
                  of the linearized network equations and constraints
                  and in studying the optimized network operation is
                  described. An application of the method to an
                  existing network in the United Kingdom is presented,
                  showing that considerable savings are possible. The
                  method was found to be robust and with low
                  computation-time requirements, and is therefore
                  suitable for real-time implementation.",

  abstract =     {The team orienteering problem {(TOP)} involves
                  finding a set of paths from the starting point to
                  the ending point such that the total collected
                  reward received from visiting a subset of locations
                  is maximized and the length of each path is
                  restricted by a pre-specified limit. In this paper,
                  an ant colony optimization {(ACO)} approach is
                  proposed for the team orienteering problem. Four
                  methods, i.e., the sequential,
                  deterministic-concurrent and random-concurrent and
                  simultaneous methods, are proposed to construct
                  candidate solutions in the framework of {ACO}. We
                  compare these methods according to the results
                  obtained on well-known problems from the
                  literature. Finally, we compare the algorithm with
                  several existing algorithms. The results show that
                  our algorithm is promising.},

                  features for characterizing problems' landscapes and show
                  their effectiveness in automatically constructing algorithm
                  selection models in continuous black-box optimization
                  problems. Focusing on algorithm performance results of the
                  COCO platform of several years, we construct a representative
                  set of high-performing complementary solvers and present an
                  algorithm selection model that, compared to the portfolio's
                  single best solver, on average requires less than half of the
                  resources for solving a given problem. Therefore, there is a
                  huge gain in efficiency compared to classical ensemble
                  methods combined with an increased insight into problem
                  characteristics and algorithm properties by using informative
                  features. The model acts on the assumption that the function
                  set of the Black-Box Optimization Benchmark is representative
                  enough for practical applications. The model allows for
                  selecting the best suited optimization algorithm within the
                  considered set for unseen problems prior to the optimization
                  itself based on a small sample of function evaluations. Note
                  that such a sample can even be reused for the initial
                  population of an evolutionary (optimization) algorithm so
                  that even the feature costs become negligible. }

  abstract =     {We propose a practical Bayesian optimization method over
                  sets, to minimize a black-box function that takes a set as a
                  single input. Because set inputs are permutation-invariant,
                  traditional Gaussian process-based Bayesian optimization
                  strategies which assume vector inputs can fall short. To
                  address this, we develop a Bayesian optimization method with
                  \emph{set kernel} that is used to build surrogate
                  functions. This kernel accumulates similarity over set
                  elements to enforce permutation-invariance, but this comes at
                  a greater computational cost. To reduce this burden, we
                  propose two key components: (i) a more efficient approximate
                  set kernel which is still positive-definite and is an
                  unbiased estimator of the true set kernel with upper-bounded
                  variance in terms of the number of subsamples, (ii) a
                  constrained acquisition function optimization over sets,
                  which uses symmetry of the feasible region that defines a set
                  input. Finally, we present several numerical experiments
                  which demonstrate that our method outperforms other methods.},

                  was published in 2000. We summarize and categorize a
                  large number of heuristics that have recently been
                  proposed in the literature. Most of these heuristics
                  are then evaluated in a computational study and
                  compared on the basis of our standardized
                  experimental design. Based on the computational
                  results we discuss features of good heuristics. The
                  paper closes with some remarks on our test design
                  and a summary of the recent developments in research

                  extensively. Among them, nearest neighbor queries are
                  important in many settings, including spatial databases (Find
                  the k closest cities) and multimedia databases (Find the k
                  most similar images). Previous analyses have concluded that
                  nearest-neighbor search is hopeless in high dimensions due to
                  the notorious "curse of dimensionality". We show that this
                  may be overpessimistic. We show that what determines the
                  search performance (at least for R-tree-like structures) is
                  the intrinsic dimensionality of the data set and not the
                  dimensionality of the address space (referred to as the
                  embedding dimensionality). The typical (and often implicit)
                  assumption in many previous studies is that the data is
                  uniformly distributed, with independence between
                  attributes. However, real data sets overwhelmingly disobey
                  these assumptions; rather, they typically are skewed and
                  exhibit intrinsic ("fractal") dimensionalities that are much
                  lower than their embedding dimension, e.g. due to subtle
                  dependencies between attributes. We show how the Hausdorff
                  and Correlation fractal dimensions of a data set can yield
                  extremely accurate formulas that can predict the I/O
                  performance to within one standard deviation on multiple real
                  and synthetic data sets.}

                  ant colony optimization, are widely used for different
                  combinatorial optimization problems. These algorithms rely
                  heavily on the use of randomness and are hard to understand
                  from a theoretical point of view. This paper contributes to
                  the theoretical analysis of ant colony optimization and
                  studies this type of algorithm on one of the most prominent
                  combinatorial optimization problems, namely the traveling
                  salesperson problem (TSP). We present a new construction
                  graph and show that it has a stronger local property than one
                  commonly used for constructing solutions of the TSP. The
                  rigorous runtime analysis for two ant colony optimization
                  algorithms, based on these two construction procedures, shows
                  that they lead to good approximation in expected polynomial
                  time on random instances. Furthermore, we point out in which
                  situations our algorithms get trapped in local optima and
                  show where the use of the right amount of heuristic
                  information is provably beneficial.",

  abstract =     {Application of heuristic solution procedures to the
                  practical problem of project scheduling has
                  previously been studied by numerous
                  researchers. However, there is little consensus
                  about their findings, and the practicing manager is
                  currently at a loss as to which scheduling rule to
                  use. Furthermore, since no categorization process
                  was developed, it is assumed that once a rule is
                  selected it must be used throughout the whole
                  project. This research breaks away from this
                  tradition by providing a categorization process
                  based on two powerful project summary measures. The
                  first measure identifies the location of the peak of
                  total resource requirements and the second measure
                  identifies the rate of utilization of each resource
                  type. The performance of the rules are classified
                  according to values of these two measures, and it is
                  shown that a rule introduced by this research
                  performs significantly better on most categories of
                  projects.},

                  space is presented. Theoretical and experimental results
                  illustrate the usefulness of the method for such problems as
                  the experimental optimization of the performance of a system
                  with a very general multipeak performance function when the
                  only available information is noise-distributed samples of
                  the function. At present, its usefulness is restricted to
                  optimization with respect to one system parameter. The
                  observations are taken sequentially; but, as opposed to the
                  gradient method, the observation may be located anywhere on
                  the parameter interval. A sequence of estimates of the
                  location of the curve maximum is generated. The location of
                  the next observation may be interpreted as the location of
                  the most likely competitor (with the current best estimate)
                  for the location of the curve maximum. A Brownian motion
                  stochastic process is selected as a model for the unknown
                  function, and the observations are interpreted with respect
                  to the model. The model gives the results a simple intuitive
                  interpretation and allows the use of simple but efficient
                  sampling procedures. The resulting process possesses some
                  powerful convergence properties in the presence of noise; it
                  is nonparametric and, despite its generality, is efficient in
                  the use of observations. The approach seems quite promising
                  as a solution to many of the problems of experimental system
                  optimization.},

  abstract =     {Traffic signals play a critical role in smart cities for
                  mitigating traffic congestions and reducing the emission in
                  metropolitan areas. This paper proposes a bi-level
                  optimization framework to settle the optimal traffic signal
                  setting problem. The upper-level problem determines the
                  traffic signal settings to minimize the drivers' average
                  travel time, while the lower-level problem aims for achieving
                  the network equilibrium using the settings calculated at the
                  upper level. Genetic algorithm is employed with the
                  integration of microscopic-traffic-simulation based dynamic
                  traffic assignment (DTA) to decouple the complex bi-level
                  problem into tractable single-level problems which are solved
                  sequentially. Case studies on a synthetic traffic network and
                  a real-world traffic subnetwork are conducted to examine the
                  effectiveness of the proposed model and relevant solution
                  methods. Additional strategies are provided for the extension
                  of the proposed model and the acceleration solution process
                  in large-area traffic network applications.},

  abstract = {Performance of machine learning algorithms depends critically on identifying a good set of hyperparameters. While recent approaches use Bayesian optimization to adaptively select configurations, we focus on speeding up random search through adaptive resource allocation and early-stopping. We formulate hyperparameter optimization as a pure-exploration non-stochastic infinite-armed bandit problem where a predefined resource like iterations, data samples, or features is allocated to randomly sampled configurations. We introduce a novel algorithm, our algorithm , for this framework and analyze its theoretical properties, providing several desirable guarantees. Furthermore, we compare our algorithm with popular Bayesian optimization methods on a suite of hyperparameter optimization problems. We observe that our algorithm can provide over an order-of-magnitude speedup over our competitor set on a variety of deep-learning and kernel-based learning problems.},

                  approximating the efficient set of multiobjective
                  combinatorial optimization problems. We focus on algorithms
                  defined by a neighborhood structure and a dominance relation
                  that iteratively improve an archive of nondominated
                  solutions. Such methods are referred to as dominance-based
                  multiobjective local search. We first provide a concise
                  overview of existing algorithms, and we propose a model
                  trying to unify them through a fine-grained
                  decomposition. The main problem-independent search components
                  of dominance relation, solution selection, neighborhood
                  exploration and archiving are largely discussed. Then, a
                  number of state-of-the-art and original strategies are
                  experimented on solving a permutation flowshop scheduling
                  problem and a traveling salesman problem, both on a two- and
                  a three-objective formulation. Experimental results and a
                  statistical comparison are reported in the paper, and some
                  directions for future research are highlighted.",

                  techniques used in analyzing and understanding the
                  performance of computer systems. Throughout the book, the
                  emphasis is on practical methods of measurement, simulation,
                  and analytical modeling. The author discusses performance
                  metrics and provides detailed coverage of the strategies used
                  in benchmark programmes. He gives intuitive explanations of
                  the key statistical tools needed to interpret measured
                  performance data. He also describes the general 'design of
                  experiments' technique, and shows how the maximum amount of
                  information can be obtained for the minimum effort. The book
                  closes with a chapter on the technique of queueing
                  analysis. Appendices listing common probability distributions
                  and statistical tables are included, along with a glossary of
                  important technical terms. This practically-oriented book
                  will be of great interest to anyone who wants a detailed, yet
                  intuitive, understanding of computer systems performance

                  studied by rigorous runtime analyses. Building upon previous
                  results for the special case of 1-MMAS, it is studied to what
                  extent an enlarged colony using $\lambda$ ants per vertex
                  helps in tracking an oscillating optimum. It is shown that
                  easy cases of oscillations can be tracked by a constant
                  number of ants. However, the paper also identifies more
                  involved oscillations that with overwhelming probability
                  cannot be tracked with any polynomial-size colony. Finally,
                  parameters of dynamic shortest-path problems which make the
                  optimum difficult to track are discussed. Experiments

  abstract =     {The travelling salesman problem with time windows is
                  a difficult optimization problem that arises, for
                  example, in logistics. This paper deals with the
                  minimization of the travel-cost. For solving this
                  problem, this paper proposes a Beam-ACO algorithm,
                  which is a hybrid method combining ant colony
                  optimization with beam search.  In general, Beam-ACO
                  algorithms heavily rely on accurate and
                  computationally inexpensive bounding information for
                  differentiating between partial solutions. This work
                  uses stochastic sampling as a useful alternative. An
                  extensive experimental evaluation on seven benchmark
                  sets from the literature shows that the proposed
                  Beam-ACO algorithm is currently a state-of-the-art
                  technique for the travelling salesman problem with
                  time windows when travel-cost optimization is

                  Computation (EC), and concerns about the reproducibility and
                  replicability of such studies have increased in recent times,
                  reflecting similar concerns in other scientific fields. In
                  this article, we suggest a classification of different types
                  of reproducibility that refines the badge system of the
                  Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) adopted by TELO. We
                  discuss, within the context of EC, the different types of
                  reproducibility as well as the concepts of artifact and
                  measurement, which are crucial for claiming
                  reproducibility. We identify cultural and technical obstacles
                  to reproducibility in the EC field. Finally, we provide
                  guidelines and suggest tools that may help to overcome some
                  of these reproducibility obstacles.",

  abstract =     {A key challenge, perhaps the central challenge, of
                  multi-objective optimization is how to deal with candidate
                  solutions that are ultimately evaluated by the hidden or
                  unknown preferences of a human decision maker (DM) who
                  understands and cares about the optimization problem.
                  Alternative ways of addressing this challenge exist but
                  perhaps the favoured one currently is the interactive
                  approach (proposed in various forms). Here, an evolutionary
                  multi-objective optimization algorithm (EMOA) is controlled
                  by a series of interactions with the DM so that preferences
                  can be elicited and the direction of search controlled. MCDM
                  has a key role to play in designing and evaluating these
                  approaches, particularly in testing them with real DMs, but
                  so far quantitative assessment of interactive EMOAs has been
                  limited.  In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework
                  for this problem of quantitative assessment, based on the
                  definition of machine decision makers (machine DMs), made
                  somewhat realistic by the incorporation of various
                  non-idealities. The machine DM proposed here draws from
                  earlier models of DM biases and inconsistencies in the MCDM
                  literature.  As a practical illustration of our approach, we
                  use the proposed machine DM to study the performance of an
                  interactive EMOA, and discuss how this framework could help
                  in the evaluation and development of better interactive
                  EMOAs.},

                  an approximation of the set of nondominated points
                  visited during a multiobjective optimization, a
                  problem commonly known as archiving. Most of the
                  currently available archiving algorithms are
                  reviewed, and what is known about their convergence
                  and approximation properties is summarized. The main
                  scenario considered is the restricted case where the
                  archive must be updated online as points are
                  generated one by one, and at most a fixed number of
                  points are to be stored in the archive at any one
                  time. In this scenario, the better-monotonicity of
                  an archiving algorithm is proposed as a weaker, but
                  more practical, property than negative efficiency
                  preservation. This paper shows that
                  hypervolume-based archivers and a recently proposed
                  multi-level grid archiver have this property. On the
                  other hand, the archiving methods used by SPEA2 and
                  NSGA-II do not, and they may better-deteriorate with
                  time. The better-monotonicity property has meaning
                  on any input sequence of points. We also classify
                  archivers according to limit properties,
                  i.e. convergence and approximation properties of the
                  archiver in the limit of infinite (input) samples
                  from a finite space with strictly positive
                  generation probabilities for all points. This paper
                  establishes a number of research questions, and
                  provides the initial framework and analysis for
                  answering them.},

  networks has never had more significance than today. The greatest
  energy savings can be obtained by careful scheduling of operation of
  pumps. Schedules can be defined either implicitly, in terms of other
  elements of the network such as tank levels, or explicitly by
  specifying the time during which each pump is on/off. The
  traditional representation of explicit schedules is a string of
  binary values with each bit representing pump on/off status during a
  particular time interval. In this paper a new explicit
  representation is presented. It is based on time controlled
  triggers, where the maximum number of pump switches is specified
  beforehand. In this representation a pump schedule is divided into a
  series of integers with each integer representing the number of
  hours for which a pump is active/inactive. This reduces the number
  of potential schedules (search space) compared to the binary
  representation. Ant colony optimization (ACO) is a stochastic
  meta-heuristic for combinatorial optimization problems that is
  inspired by the foraging behavior of some species of ants. In this
  paper, an application of the ACO framework was developed for the
  optimal scheduling of pumps. The proposed representation was adapted
  to an ant colony Optimization framework and solved for the optimal
  pump schedules. Minimization of electrical cost was considered as
  the objective, while satisfying system constraints. Instead of using
  a penalty function approach for constraint violations, constraint
  violations were ordered according to their importance and solutions
  were ranked based on this order. The proposed approach was tested on
  a small test network and on a large real-world network. Results are
  compared with those obtained using a simple genetic algorithm based
  on binary representation and a hybrid genetic algorithm that uses
  level-based triggers.}

                  contain less switches than the maximum. In these
                  representations, a pump schedule is divided into a
                  series of integers with each integer representing
                  the number of hours for which a pump is
                  active/inactive.  This reduces the number of
                  potential schedules compared to the binary
                  representation, and allows the algorithm to operate
                  on the feasible region of the search space.  We
                  propose evolutionary operators for these two new
                  representations. The new representations and their
                  corresponding operations are compared with the two
                  most-used representations in pump scheduling,
                  namely, binary representation and level-controlled
                  triggers. A detailed statistical analysis of the
                  results indicates which parameters have the greatest
                  effect on the performance of evolutionary
                  algorithms. The empirical results show that an
                  evolutionary algorithm using the proposed
                  representations improves over the results obtained
                  by a recent state-of-the-art Hybrid Genetic
                  Algorithm for pump scheduling using level-controlled
                  triggers.}

Multi-objective optimization problems are problems with several,
typically conflicting criteria for evaluating solutions. Without
any a priori preference information, the Pareto optimality
principle establishes a partial order among solutions, and the
output of the algorithm becomes a set of nondominated solutions
rather than a single one. Various ant colony optimization (ACO)
algorithms have been proposed in recent years for solving such
problems. These multi-objective ACO (MOACO) algorithms exhibit
different design choices for dealing with the particularities of
the multi-objective context. This paper proposes a formulation of
algorithmic components that suffices to describe most MOACO
algorithms proposed so far. This formulation also shows that
existing MOACO algorithms often share equivalent design choices
but they are described in different terms. Moreover, this
formulation is synthesized into a flexible algorithmic framework,
from which not only existing MOACO algorithms may be
instantiated, but also combinations of components that were never
studied in the literature. In this sense, this paper goes beyond
proposing a new MOACO algorithm, but it rather introduces a
family of MOACO algorithms. The flexibility of the proposed MOACO
framework facilitates the application of automatic algorithm
configuration techniques. The experimental results presented in
this paper show that the automatically configured MOACO framework
outperforms the MOACO algorithms that inspired the framework
itself. This paper is also among the first to apply automatic
algorithm configuration techniques to multi-objective algorithms.}

                  anytime behaviour is a difficult task, because performance is
                  often evaluated subjectively, by plotting the trade-off curve
                  between computation time and solution quality. Yet, the
                  trade-off curve may be modelled also as a set of mutually
                  nondominated, bi-objective points. Using this model, we
                  propose to combine an automatic configuration tool and the
                  hypervolume measure, which assigns a single quality measure
                  to a nondominated set. This allows us to improve the anytime
                  behaviour of optimisation algorithms by means of
                  automatically finding algorithmic configurations that produce
                  the best nondominated sets. Moreover, the recently proposed
                  weighted hypervolume measure is used here to incorporate the
                  decision-maker's preferences into the automatic tuning
                  procedure. We report on the improvements reached when
                  applying the proposed method to two relevant scenarios: (i)
                  the design of parameter variation strategies for MAX-MIN Ant
                  System and (ii) the tuning of the anytime behaviour of SCIP,

                  to a project is limited and not sufficient to
                  execute all the concurrent activities. In this
                  situation, decision making about their schedule is
                  necessary. Many times this schedule supposes an
                  increase in the project completion
                  time. Additionally, companies commonly manage
                  various projects simultaneously, sharing a pool of
                  renewable resources. Given these resource
                  constraints, we often can only apply heuristic
                  methods to solve the scheduling problem. In this
                  work the effect of the schedule generation schemes -
                  serial or parallel - and priority rules - {MINLFT},
                  {MINSLK}, {MAXTWK}, {SASP} or {FCFS} - with two
                  approaches - multi-project and single-project - are
                  analysed. The time criteria considered are the mean
                  project delay and the multiproject duration
                  increase. Through an extensive computational study,
                  results show that with the parallel scheduling
                  generation scheme and the multi-project approach the
                  project manager can obtain a good multiproject
                  schedule with the time criterion selected:
                  minimising mean project delay or minimising
                  multiproject duration increase. New heuristics -
                  based on priority rules with a two-phase approach -
                  that outperform classical ones are proposed to
                  minimise mean project delay with a multi-project
                  approach. Finally, the best heuristics analysed are
                  evaluated together with a representative sample of
                  commercial project management software.},

                  constraints. In this paper, we focus on this problem
                  and develop a hybrid Genetic Algorithm ({MM-HGA)} to
                  solve it. Its main contributions are the mode
                  assignment procedure, the fitness function and the
                  use of a very efficient improving method. Its
                  performance is demonstrated by extensive
                  computational results obtained on a set of standard
                  instances and against the best currently available

                  {Pareto} Local Search, to find a good approximation of the
                  efficient set of the biobjective traveling salesman
                  problem. In the first phase of the method, an initial
                  population composed of a good approximation of the extreme
                  supported efficient solutions is generated. We use as second
                  phase a {Pareto} Local Search method applied to each solution
                  of the initial population. We show that using the combination
                  of these two techniques: good initial population generation
                  plus {Pareto} Local Search gives better results than
                  state-of-the-art algorithms. Two other points are introduced:
                  the notion of ideal set and a simple way to produce
                  near-efficient solutions of multiobjective problems, by using
                  an efficient single-objective solver with a data perturbation

                  platform that poses the challenge of building AI agents with
                  general competency across dozens of Atari 2600 games. It
                  supports a variety of different problem settings and it has
                  been receiving increasing attention from the scientific
                  community, leading to some high-pro_le success stories such
                  as the much publicized Deep Q-Networks (DQN). In this article
                  we take a big picture look at how the ALE is being used by
                  the research community. We show how diverse the evaluation
                  methodologies in the ALE have become with time, and highlight
                  some key concerns when evaluating agents in the ALE. We use
                  this discussion to present some methodological best practices
                  and provide new benchmark results using these best
                  practices. To further the progress in the field, we introduce
                  a new version of the ALE that supports multiple game modes
                  and provides a form of stochasticity we call sticky
                  actions. We conclude this big picture look by revisiting
                  challenges posed when the ALE was introduced, summarizing the
                  state-of-the-art in various problems and highlighting
                  problems that remain open.},

                  that the particular output has not been compromised by a
                  bug. A user of a certifying algorithm inputs x, receives the
                  output y and the certificate w, and then checks, either
                  manually or by use of a program, that w proves that y is a
                  correct output for input x. In this way, he/she can be sure
                  of the correctness of the output without having to trust the
                  algorithm. We put forward the thesis that certifying
                  algorithms are much superior to non-certifying algorithms,
                  and that for complex algorithmic tasks, only certifying
                  algorithms are satisfactory. Acceptance of this thesis would
                  lead to a change of how algorithms are taught and how
                  algorithms are researched. The widespread use of certifying
                  algorithms would greatly enhance the reliability of
                  algorithmic software. We survey the state of the art in
                  certifying algorithms and add to it. In particular, we start
                  a theory of certifying algorithms and prove that the concept
                  is universal."

                  paper typically produces costs within 1\% of a
                  linear program-based solution, and can incorporate
                  realistic non-linear costs that may be hard to

                  formulations. These costs include pump switching and
                  maximum demand charges. A simplified model is
                  derived from a standard hydraulic simulator. An
                  initial schedule is produced by a descent
                  method. Two-stage simulated annealing then produces
                  solutions in a few minutes. Iterative recalibration
                  ensures that the solution agrees closely with the
                  results from a full hydraulic simulation.",

                  Techniques and Simulation Speedups},
  abstract =     {Although experimental studies have been widely applied to the
                  investigation of algorithm performance, very little attention
                  has been given to experimental method in this area. This is
                  unfortunate, since much can be done to improve the quality of
                  the data obtained; often, much improvement may be needed for
                  the data to be useful. This paper gives a tutorial discussion
                  of two aspects of good experimental technique: the use of
                  variance reduction techniques and simulation speedups in
                  algorithm studies.  In an illustrative study, application of
                  variance reduction techniques produces a decrease in variance
                  by a factor 1000 in one case, giving a dramatic improvement
                  in the precision of experimental results. Furthermore, the
                  complexity of the simulation program is improved from
                  $\Theta(m n/H_n)$ to $\Theta(m + n \log n)$ (where $m$ is
                  typically much larger than $n$), giving a much faster
                  simulation program and therefore more data per unit of
                  computation time. The general application of variance
                  reduction techniques is also discussed for a variety of
                  algorithm problem domains.},

                  problems. In interactive methods, a decision maker
                  plays an important part and the idea is to support
                  her/him in the search for the most preferred
                  solution. In interactive methods, steps of an
                  iterative solution algorithm are repeated and the
                  decision maker progressively provides preference
                  information so that the most preferred solution can
                  be found. We identify three types of specifying
                  preference information in interactive methods and
                  give some examples of methods representing each
                  type. The types are methods based on trade-off

  abstract =     { This paper studies the learning process in an ant
                  colony optimization algorithm designed to solve the
                  problem of ordering cars on an assembly line
                  (car-sequencing problem). This problem has been
                  shown to be {NP-hard} and evokes a great deal of
                  interest among practitioners. Learning in an ant
                  algorithm is achieved by using an artificial
                  pheromone trail, which is a central element of this
                  metaheuristic. Many versions of the algorithm are
                  found in literature, the main distinction among them
                  being the management of the pheromone
                  trail. Nevertheless, few of them seek to perfect
                  learning by modifying the internal structure of the
                  trail. In this paper, a new pheromone trail
                  structure is proposed that is specifically adapted
                  to the type of constraints in the car-sequencing
                  problem. The quality of the results obtained when
                  solving three sets of benchmark problems is superior
                  to that of the best solutions found in literature
                  and shows the efficiency of the specialized trail.},

                  and practicality for larger problems using conventional
                  software. In the problem used, the nonlinear simulated DM
                  utility function applied resulted in a nonextreme point
                  solution. Very often, the preferred solution could end up
                  being an extreme point solution, in which case the techniques
                  relying upon LP concepts would work as well if not better
                  than utilizing constrained objective attainments. The point
                  is that there is no reason to expect linear or near linear
                  utility."

  abstract =     {This paper presents a genetic algorithm (GA) for solving the
                  traveling salesman problem (TSP). To construct a powerful GA,
                  we use edge assembly crossover (EAX) and make substantial
                  enhancements to it: (i) localization of EAX together with its
                  efficient implementation and (ii) the use of a local search
                  procedure in EAX to determine good combinations of building
                  blocks of parent solutions for generating even better
                  offspring solutions from very high-quality parent
                  solutions. In addition, we develop (iii) an innovative
                  selection model for maintaining population diversity at a
                  negligible computational cost. Experimental results on
                  well-studied TSP benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed GA
                  outperforms state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms in finding
                  very high-quality solutions on instances with up to 200,000
                  cities. In contrast to the state-of-the-art TSP heuristics,
                  which are all based on the Lin-Kernighan (LK) algorithm, our
                  GA achieves top performance without using an LK-based
                  algorithm.}

                  with existing observations and testing hypotheses with new
                  observations. This distinction between postdiction and
                  prediction is appreciated conceptually but is not respected
                  in practice. Mistaking generation of postdictions with
                  testing of predictions reduces the credibility of research
                  findings. However, ordinary biases in human reasoning, such
                  as hindsight bias, make it hard to avoid this mistake. An
                  effective solution is to define the research questions and
                  analysis plan before observing the research outcomes--a
                  process called preregistration. Preregistration distinguishes
                  analyses and outcomes that result from predictions from those
                  that result from postdictions. A variety of practical
                  strategies are available to make the best possible use of
                  preregistration in circumstances that fall short of the ideal
                  application, such as when the data are preexisting. Services
                  are now available for preregistration across all disciplines,
                  facilitating a rapid increase in the practice. Widespread
                  adoption of preregistration will increase distinctiveness
                  between hypothesis generation and hypothesis testing and will
                  improve the credibility of research findings.},

                  trade-offs among conflicting objectives must be
                  reconciled. Interactive multiobjective programming provides a
                  means for decision makers to learn what these trade-offs
                  involve, while the mathematical program generates solutions
                  that seek improvement of the implied utility of the decision
                  maker. A variety of multiobjective programming techniques
                  have been presented in the multicriteria decision-making
                  literature. This study reviews published studies with human
                  subjects where some of these techniques were applied. While
                  all of the techniques have the ability to support decision
                  makers under conditions of multiple objectives, a number of
                  features in applying these systems have been tested by these
                  studies. A general evolution of techniques is traced,
                  starting with methods relying upon linear combinations of
                  value, to more recent methods capable of reflecting nonlinear
                  trade-offs of value. Support of nonlinear utility and
                  enhancing decision-maker learning are considered.},

                  chlorination stations, under unsteady
                  hydraulics. The objective is to minimize the total
                  cost of operating the pumping units and the chlorine
                  booster operation and design for a selected
                  operational time horizon, while delivering the
                  consumers required water quantities, at acceptable
                  pressures and chlorine residual concentrations. The
                  decision variables, for each of the time steps that
                  encompass the total operational time horizon,
                  include: the scheduling of the pumping units,
                  settings of the water distribution system control
                  valves, and the mass injection rates at each of the
                  booster chlorination stations. The constraints are
                  domain heads and chlorine concentrations at the
                  consumer nodes, maximum injection rates at the
                  chlorine injection stations, maximum allowable
                  amounts of water withdraws at the sources, and
                  returning at the end of the operational time horizon
                  to a prescribed total volume in the tanks. The model

                  timetabling and course timetabling
                  problems. Usually, these problems are characterized
                  by multiple conflicting objectives. A multiobjective
                  formalization of these problems is presented, based
                  on goals and priorities. Various aspects of
                  evolutionary algorithms are proposed and studied for
                  these problems, particulary, selection methods and
                  types and parameters of mutation operator. The
                  choice of both representation and operators is made
                  so as not to favour excessively certain objectives
                  with respect to others at the level of the
                  exploration mechanism. A comparative study of
                  performance is presented for the proposed algorithms
                  by means of statistical inference, based on real
                  problems of the University of Algarve. The notion of
                  attainment functions is used as a base for the
                  assessment of performance of multiobjective
                  evolutionary algorithms. Finally, the evolution of
                  the solution cost during the runs is analysed by
                  means of attainment functions, as well.}

  ABSTRACT =     "The measure of the region dominated by (the maxima
                  of) a set of $n$ points in the positive $d$-orthant
                  has been proposed as an indicator of performance in
                  multiobjective optimization, known as the
                  hypervolume indicator, and the problem of computing
                  it efficiently is attracting increasing
                  attention. In this report, this problem is
                  formulated as a special case of Klee's measure
                  problem in $d$ dimensions, which immediately
                  establishes $O(n^{d/2}\log n)$ as a, possibly
                  conservative, upper bound on the required
                  computation time. Then, an $O(n log n)$ algorithm
                  for the 3-dimensional version of this special case
                  is constructed, based on an existing dimension-sweep
                  algorithm for the related maxima problem. Finally,
                  $O(n log n)$ is shown to remain a lower bound on the
                  time required by the hypervolume indicator for
                  $d>1$, which attests the optimality of the algorithm

  ABSTRACT =     {Effective Stochastic Local Search (SLS) algorithms
                  can be seen as being composed of several algorithmic
                  components, each of which plays some specific role
                  with respect to overall performance. In this
                  article, we explore the application of experimental
                  design techniques to analyze the effect of different
                  choices for these algorithmic components on SLS
                  algorithms applied to Multiobjective Combinatorial
                  Optimization Problems that are solved in terms of
                  {Pareto} optimality. This analysis is done using the
                  example application of SLS algorithms to the
                  biobjective Quadratic Assignment Problem and we show
                  also that the same choices for algorithmic
                  components can lead to different behavior in
                  dependence of various instance features, such as the
                  structure of input data and the correlation between
                  objectives.},

  ABSTRACT =     { Stochastic Local Search (SLS) algorithms for
                  Multiobjective Combinatorial Optimization Problems
                  (MCOPs) typically involve the selection and
                  parameterization of many algorithm components whose
                  role with respect to their overall performance and
                  relation to certain instance features is often not
                  clear. In this abstract, we use a modular approach
                  for the design of SLS algorithms for MCOPs defined
                  in terms of {Pareto} optimality and we present an
                  extensive analysis of SLS algorithms through
                  experimental design techniques, where each algorithm
                  component is considered a factor. The experimental
                  analysis is based on a sound experimental
                  methodology for analyzing the output of algorithms
                  for MCOPs. We show that different choices for
                  algorithm components can lead to different behavior
                  in dependence of various instance features.},

                  configuration software has not been explored, even though, as
                  we show in this article, the performance of the compiled code
                  has significant stochasticity, just as standard optimization
                  algorithms. As a practical case study, we consider the
                  configuration of the well-known GNU compiler collection (GCC)
                  for minimizing the run-time of machine code for various
                  heuristic search methods. Our experimental results show that,
                  depending on the specific code to be optimized, improvements
                  of up to 40{\%} of execution time when compared to the -O2
                  and -O3 optimization flags is possible.",

                  satisfaction optimization problems, in particular
                  the static and dynamic maximum satisfiability
                  problems {(MAX-SAT).} In the first part of the
                  chapter we give an introduction to meta-heuristics
                  in general and ant colony optimization in
                  particular, followed by an introduction to
                  constraint satisfaction and static and dynamic
                  constraint satisfaction optimization problems.
                  Then, we describe how to apply the {ACO} algorithm
                  to the problems, and do an analysis of the results
                  obtained for several benchmarks.  The adapted ant
                  colony optimization accomplishes very well the task
                  of dealing with systematic changes of dynamic
                  {MAX-SAT} instances derived from static problems.  },

                  problems called ant system for multi-level
                  lot-sizing algorithm {(ASMLLS).} We apply a hybrid
                  approach where we use ant colony optimization in
                  order to find a good lot-sizing sequence, i.e. a
                  sequence of the different items in the product
                  structure in which we apply a modified
                  {Wagner-Whitin} algorithm for each item
                  separately. Based on the setup costs each ant
                  generates a sequence of items. Afterwards a simple
                  single-stage lot-sizing rule is applied with
                  modified setup costs. This modification of the setup
                  costs depends on the position of the item in the
                  lot-sizing sequence, on the items which have been
                  lot-sized before, and on two further parameters,
                  which are tried to be improved by a systematic
                  search. For small-sized problems {ASMLLS} is among
                  the best algorithms, but for most medium- and
                  large-sized problems it outperforms all other
                  approaches regarding solution quality as well as

                  with known demands to a root node through a minimum
                  cost tree network, subject to capacity constraints
                  on all links is known as the capacitated minimum
                  spanning tree {(CMST)} problem. As the problem is
                  {NP-hard,} we propose a hybrid ant colony
                  optimization {(ACO)} algorithm to tackle it
                  heuristically. The algorithm exploits two important
                  problem characteristics: (i) the {CMST} problem is
                  closely related to the capacitated vehicle routing
                  problem {(CVRP),} and (ii) given a clustering of
                  client nodes that satisfies capacity constraints,
                  the solution is to find a {MST} for each cluster,
                  which can be done exactly in polynomial time. Our
                  {ACO} exploits these two characteristics of the
                  {CMST} by a solution construction originally
                  developed for the {CVRP.} Given the {CVRP} solution,
                  we then apply an implementation of Prim's algorithm
                  to each cluster to obtain a feasible {CMST}
                  solution. Results from a comprehensive computational
                  study indicate the efficiency and effectiveness of
                  the proposed approach.},

                  prediction model called MAKER-RIMER to examine how different
                  features embedded in Twitter posts (tweets) can predict the
                  number of retweets achieved during an electoral campaign. The
                  tweets posted by the two most voted candidates during the
                  official campaign for the 2017 Ecuadorian Presidential
                  election were used for this research. For each tweet, five
                  features including type of tweet, emotion, URL, hashtag, and
                  date are identified and coded to predict if tweets are of
                  either high or low impact. The main contributions of the new
                  proposed model include its suitability to analyse tweet
                  datasets based on likelihood analysis of data. The model is
                  interpretable, and the prediction process relies only on the
                  use of available data. The experimental results show that
                  MAKER-RIMER performed better, in terms of misclassification
                  error, when compared against other predictive machine
                  learning approaches. In addition, the model allows observing
                  which features of the candidates' tweets are linked to high
                  and low impact. Tweets containing allusions to the contender
                  candidate, either with positive or negative connotations,
                  without hashtags, and written towards the end of the
                  campaign, were persistently those with the highest
                  impact. URLs, on the other hand, is the only variable that
                  performs differently for the two candidates in terms of
                  achieving high impact. MAKER-RIMER can provide campaigners of
                  political parties or candidates with a tool to measure how
                  features of tweets are predictors of their impact, which can
                  be useful to tailor Twitter content during electoral
                  campaigns.",

                  multiobjective optimization problems is that no explicit
                  formulation of the problem is available. Instead, a dataset
                  containing vectors of decision variables together with their
                  objective function value(s) is given and a surrogate model
                  (or metamodel) is build from the data and used for
                  optimization and decision-making. This data-driven
                  optimization process strongly depends on the ability of the
                  surrogate model to predict the objective value of decision
                  variables not present in the original dataset. Therefore, the
                  choice of surrogate modelling technique is crucial. While
                  many surrogate modelling techniques have been discussed in
                  the literature, there is no standard procedure that will
                  select the best technique for a given problem. In this work,
                  we propose the automatic selection of a surrogate modelling
                  technique based on exploratory landscape features of the
                  optimization problem that underlies the given dataset. The
                  overall idea is to learn offline from a large pool of
                  benchmark problems, on which we can evaluate a large number
                  of surrogate modelling techniques. When given a new dataset,
                  features are used to select the most appropriate surrogate
                  modelling technique. The preliminary experiments reported
                  here suggest that the proposed automatic selector is able to
                  identify high-accuracy surrogate models as long as an
                  appropriate classifier is used for selection."

                  that many real-world applications of multi-objective
                  optimization involve a large number (10 or more) of
                  objectives but then, existing evolutionary multi-objective
                  optimization (EMO) methods have primarily been applied to
                  problems having smaller number of objectives (5 or
                  less). After highlighting the major impediments in handling
                  large number of objectives, we proposed a principal component
                  analysis (PCA) based EMO procedure, for dimensionality
                  reduction, whose efficacy was demonstrated by solving upto
                  50-objective optimization problems. Here, we are addressing
                  the fact that, when the data points live on a non-linear
                  manifold or that the data structure is non-gaussian, PCA
                  which yields a smaller dimensional 'linear' subspace may be
                  ineffective in revealing the underlying dimensionality. To
                  overcome this, we propose two new non-linear dimensionality
                  reduction algorithms for evolutionary multi-objective
                  optimization, namely C-PCA-NSGA-II and MVU-PCA-NSGA-II. While
                  the former is based on the newly introduced correntropy PCA
                  [2], the later implements maximum variance unfolding
                  principle [3,4,5] in a novel way. We also establish the
                  superiority of these new EMO procedures over the earlier
                  PCA-based procedure, both in terms of accuracy and
                  computational time, by solving upto 50-objective optimization

                  techniques for the multi-objective orienteering
                  problem are developed. The motivation stems from the
                  problem of planning individual tourist routes in a
                  city. Each point of interest in a city provides
                  different benefits for different categories (e.g.,
                  culture, shopping). Each tourist has different
                  preferences for the different categories when
                  selecting and visiting the points of interests
                  (e.g., museums, churches). Hence, a multi-objective
                  decision situation arises.  To determine all the
                  Pareto optimal solutions, two metaheuristic search
                  techniques are developed and applied. We use the
                  Pareto ant colony optimization algorithm and extend
                  the design of the variable neighborhood search
                  method to the multi-objective case. Both methods are
                  hybridized with path relinking procedures. The
                  performances of the two algorithms are tested on
                  several benchmark instances as well as on real world
                  instances from different Austrian regions and the
                  cities of Vienna and Padua.  The computational
                  results show that both implemented methods are well
                  performing algorithms to solve the multi-objective
                  orienteering problem.},

                  to optimize several conflicting objectives simultaneously
                  under uncertainty. We propose visualization tools to support
                  the solution of such scenario-based multiobjective
                  optimization problems. Suitable graphical visualizations are
                  necessary to support managers in understanding, evaluating,
                  and comparing the performances of management decisions
                  according to all objectives in all plausible scenarios. To
                  date, no appropriate visualization has been suggested. This
                  paper fills this gap by proposing two visualization methods:
                  a novel extension of empirical attainment functions for
                  scenarios and an adapted version of heatmaps. They help a
                  decision-maker in gaining insight into realizations of
                  trade-offs and comparisons between objective functions in
                  different scenarios. Some fundamental questions that a
                  decision-maker may wish to answer with the help of
                  visualizations are also identified. Several examples are
                  utilized to illustrate how the proposed visualizations
                  support a decision-maker in evaluating and comparing
                  solutions to be able to make a robust decision by answering
                  the questions. Finally, we validate the usefulness of the
                  proposed visualizations in a real-world problem with a real
                  decision-maker. We conclude with guidelines regarding which
                  of the proposed visualizations are best suited for different

  abstract =     "This paper presents a scenario-based Multi-Objective
                  structure to handle decision problems under deep
                  uncertainty. Most of the decisions in real-life problems need
                  to be made in the absence of complete knowledge about the
                  consequences of the decision and/or are characterised by
                  uncertainties about the future which is unpredictable. These
                  uncertainties are almost impossible to reduce by gathering
                  more information and are not statistical in
                  nature. Therefore, classical probability-based approaches,
                  such as stochastic programming, do not address these
                  problems; as they require a correctly-defined complete sample
                  space, strong assumptions (e.g. normality), or both. The
                  proposed method extends the concept of two-stage stochastic
                  programming with recourse to address the capability of
                  dealing with deep uncertainty through the use of scenario
                  planning rather than statistical expectation. In this
                  research, scenarios are used as a dimension of preference to
                  avoid problems relating to the assessment and use of
                  probabilities under deep uncertainty. Such scenario-based
                  thinking involved a multi-objective representation of
                  performance under different future conditions as an
                  alternative to expectation. To the best of our knowledge,
                  this is the first attempt of performing a multi-criteria
                  evaluation under deep uncertainty through a structured
                  optimisation model. The proposed structure replacing
                  probabilities (in dynamic systems with deep uncertainties) by
                  aspirations within a goal programming structure. In fact,
                  this paper also proposes an extension of the goal programming
                  paradigm to deal with deep uncertainty. Furthermore, we will
                  explain how this structure can be modelled, implemented, and
                  solved by Goal Programming using some simple, but not
                  trivial, examples. Further discussion and comparisons with
                  some popular existing methods will also provided to highlight
                  the superiorities of the proposed structure.",

                  supply chains (SCs) under deep uncertainty has been addressed
                  by applying a two-stage scenario-based multiobjective
                  optimisation methodology. In practice, the depth of
                  uncertainty is very high, potential outcomes are not
                  precisely enumerable, and probabilities of outcomes are not
                  properly definable. To date, no appropriate framework has
                  been suggested for dealing with deep uncertainty in supply
                  chain management and energy-related problems. This study is
                  the first try to fills this gap. Particularly, the
                  sustainability of the whole infrastructure of the
                  sugar-bioethanol SCs is analysed in such a way that the final
                  solutions are sustainable, robust and adaptable for a broad
                  range of plausible futures. Three objectives are considered
                  in this problem under six uncertain parameters. A case study
                  of South African sugarcane industry is utilised to study and
                  examine the proposed model. The results prove the economic
                  profitability and sustainability of the project."

                  problems containing large number of objectives, typically
                  more than four.  Non-dominance is an inadequate strategy for
                  convergence to the Pareto front for such problems, as almost
                  all solutions in the population become non-dominated,
                  resulting in loss of convergence pressure.  However, for some

                  using only a few of the objectives, rendering the rest of the
                  objectives redundant. Such problems may be reducible to a
                  manageable number of relevant objectives, which can be
                  optimized using conventional multiobjective evolutionary
                  algorithms (MOEAs). For dimensionality reduction, most
                  proposals in the paper rely on analysis of a representative
                  set of solutions obtained by running a conventional MOEA for
                  a large number of generations, which is computationally
                  overbearing.  A novel algorithm, Pareto corner search
                  evolutionary algorithm (PCSEA), is introduced in this paper,
                  which searches for the corners of the Pareto front instead of
                  searching for the complete Pareto front. The solutions
                  obtained using PCSEA are then used for dimensionality
                  reduction to identify the relevant objectives. The potential
                  of the proposed approach is demonstrated by studying its
                  performance on a set of benchmark test problems and two
                  engineering examples. While the preliminary results obtained
                  using PCSEA are promising, there are a number of areas that
                  need further investigation. This paper provides a number of
                  useful insights into dimensionality reduction and, in
                  particular, highlights some of the roadblocks that need to be
                  cleared for future development of algorithms attempting to
                  use few selected solutions for identifying relevant
                  objectives},

  abstract =     {A number of practical optimization problems are posed as
                  many-objective (more than three objectives) problems. Most of
                  the existing evolutionary multi-objective optimization
                  algorithms, which target the entire Pareto-front are not
                  equipped to handle many-objective problems. Though there have
                  been copious efforts to overcome the challenges posed by such
                  problems, there does not exist a generic procedure to
                  effectively handle them. This paper presents a simplify and
                  solve framework for handling many-objective optimization
                  problems. In that, a given problem is simplified by
                  identification and elimination of the redundant objectives,
                  before interactively engaging the decision maker to converge
                  to the most preferred solution on the Pareto-optimal
                  front. The merit of performing objective reduction before
                  interacting with the decision maker is two fold. Firstly, the
                  revelation that certain objectives are redundant,
                  significantly reduces the complexity of the optimization
                  problem, implying lower computational cost and higher search
                  efficiency. Secondly, it is well known that human beings are
                  not efficient in handling several factors (objectives in the
                  current context) at a time. Hence, simplifying the problem a
                  priori addresses the fundamental issue of cognitive overload
                  for the decision maker, which may help avoid inconsistent
                  preferences during the different stages of interactive
                  engagement. The implementation of the proposed framework is
                  first demonstrated on a three-objective problem, followed by
                  its application on two real-world engineering problems.}

                  to water supply companies. Therefore, reducing such
                  costs through an optimal pump scheduling becomes an
                  important issue. This work presents the use of
                  Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) to
                  solve an optimal pump-scheduling problem. For the
                  first time, six different approaches were
                  implemented and compared. These algorithms aim to
                  minimise four objectives: electric energy cost,
                  pumps' maintenance cost, maximum power peak, and
                  level variation in the reservoir. In order to
                  consider hydraulic and technical constrains, a
                  heuristic constrain algorithm was developed and
                  combined with each MOEA utilised. Evaluation of
                  experimental results of a set of metrics shows that
                  the Strength {Pareto} Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA)
                  achieves the best performance for this
                  problem. Moreover, SPEA's set of solutions provide
                  pumping station operation engineers with a wide
                  range of optimal pump schedules to chose from."

  abstract =     "Automatic configuration techniques are widely and
                  successfully used to find good parameter settings for
                  optimization algorithms. Configuration is costly, because it
                  is necessary to evaluate many configurations on different
                  instances. For decision problems, when the objective is to
                  minimize the running time of the algorithm, many
                  configurators implement capping methods to discard poor
                  configurations early. Such methods are not directly
                  applicable to optimization problems, when the objective is to
                  optimize the cost of the best solution found, given a
                  predefined running time limit. We propose new capping methods
                  for the automatic configuration of optimization
                  algorithms. They use the previous executions to determine a
                  performance envelope, which is used to evaluate new
                  executions and cap those that do not satisfy the envelope
                  conditions. We integrate the capping methods into the irace
                  configurator and evaluate them on different optimization
                  scenarios. Our results show that the proposed methods can
                  save from about 5\% to 78\% of the configuration effort,
                  while finding configurations of the same quality. Based on
                  the computational analysis, we identify two conservative and
                  two aggressive methods, that save an average of about 20\%
                  and 45\% of the configuration effort, respectively. We also
                  provide evidence that capping can help to better use the
                  available budget in scenarios with a configuration time
                  limit."

                  the most relevant problems related to smart mobility: the
                  reduction of vehicles' travel time. Our original approach,
                  called Red Swarm, suggests a potentially customized route to
                  each vehicle by using several spots located at traffic lights
                  in order to avoid traffic jams by using \{V2I\}
                  communications. That is quite different from other existing
                  proposals, as it deals with real maps and actual streets, as
                  well as several road traffic distributions. We propose an
                  evolutionary algorithm (later efficiently parallelized) to
                  optimize our case studies which have been imported from
                  OpenStreetMap into \{SUMO\} as they belong to a real city. We
                  have also developed a Rerouting Algorithm which accesses the
                  configuration of the Red Swarm and communicates the route
                  chosen to vehicles, using the spots (via WiFi
                  link). Moreover, we have developed three competing algorithms
                  in order to compare their results to those of Red Swarm and
                  have observed that Red Swarm not only achieved the best
                  results, but also outperformed the experts' solutions in a
                  total of 60 scenarios tested, with up to 19\% shorter travel
                  times."

The case study is dialect leveling in the North of England, manifested as reduction of accent variation across the North and emergence of General Northern English (GNE), a pan-regional standard accent associated with middle-class speakers. We investigated this instance of dialect leveling using random forest classification, with audio data from a crowd-sourced corpus of 105 urban, mostly highly-educated speakers from five northern UK cities: Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle upon Tyne, and Sheffield. We trained random forest models to identify individual northern cities from a sample of other northern accents, based on first two formant measurements of full vowel systems. We tested the models using unseen data. We relied on undersampling, bagging (bootstrap aggregation) and leave-one-out cross-validation to address some challenges associated with the data set, such as unbalanced data and relatively small sample size. The accuracy of classification provides us with a measure of relative similarity between different pairs of cities, while calculating conditional feature importance allows us to identify which input features (which vowels and which formants) have the largest influence in the prediction. We do find a considerable degree of leveling, especially between Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield, although some differences persist. The features that contribute to these differences most systematically are typically not the ones discussed in previous dialect descriptions. We propose that the most systematic regional features are also not salient, and as such, they serve as sociolinguistic regional indicators. We supplement the random forest results with a more traditional variationist description of by-city vowel systems, and we use both sources of evidence to inform a description of the vowels of General Northern English."

  abstract =     {We consider sequential decision problems under uncertainty,
                  where we seek to optimize an unknown function from noisy
                  samples. This requires balancing exploration (learning about
                  the objective) and exploitation (localizing the maximum), a
                  problem well-studied in the multi-armed bandit literature. In
                  many applications, however, we require that the sampled
                  function values exceed some prespecified "safety" threshold,
                  a requirement that existing algorithms fail to meet. Examples
                  include medical applications where patient comfort must be
                  guaranteed, recommender systems aiming to avoid user
                  dissatisfaction, and robotic control, where one seeks to
                  avoid controls causing physical harm to the platform. We
                  tackle this novel, yet rich, set of problems under the
                  assumption that the unknown function satisfies regularity
                  conditions expressed via a Gaussian process prior. We develop
                  an efficient algorithm called SafeOpt, and theoretically
                  guarantee its convergence to a natural notion of optimum
                  reachable under safety constraints. We evaluate SafeOpt on
                  synthetic data, as well as two real applications: movie
                  recommendation, and therapeutic spinal cord stimulation.},

  abstract =     "Enforcing safety is a key aspect of many problems pertaining
                  to sequential decision making under uncertainty, which
                  require the decisions made at every step to be both
                  informative of the optimal decision and also safe. For
                  example, we value both efficacy and comfort in medical
                  therapy, and efficiency and safety in robotic control. We
                  consider this problem of optimizing an unknown utility
                  function with absolute feedback or preference feedback
                  subject to unknown safety constraints. We develop an
                  efficient safe Bayesian optimization algorithm, StageOpt,
                  that separates safe region expansion and utility function
                  maximization into two distinct stages. Compared to existing
                  approaches which interleave between expansion and
                  optimization, we show that StageOpt is more efficient and
                  naturally applicable to a broader class of problems. We
                  provide theoretical guarantees for both the satisfaction of
                  safety constraints as well as convergence to the optimal
                  utility value. We evaluate StageOpt on both a variety of
                  synthetic experiments, as well as in clinical practice. We
                  demonstrate that StageOpt is more effective than existing
                  safe optimization approaches, and is able to safely and
                  effectively optimize spinal cord stimulation therapy in our

                  algorithm (EA) for multiple objective optimization. During an
                  evolutionary search, a decision maker (DM) is asked to
                  compare pairwise solutions from the current population. Using
                  the Monte Carlo simulation, the proposed algorithm generates
                  from a uniform distribution a set of instances of the
                  preference model compatible with such an indirect preference
                  information. These instances are incorporated as the search
                  directions with the aim of systematically converging a
                  population toward the DMs most preferred region of the Pareto
                  front. The experimental comparison proves that the proposed
                  decomposition-based method outperforms the state-of-the-art
                  interactive counterparts of the dominance-based EAs. We also

                  evolutionary robotics is receiving increasing attention. A
                  survey of the literature reveals the different possibilities
                  it offers to improve the automatic design of efficient and
                  adaptive robotic systems, and points to the successful
                  demonstrations available for both task-specific and
                  task-agnostic approaches (i.e., with or without reference to
                  the specific design problem to be tackled). However, the
                  advantages of multi-objective approaches over
                  single-objective ones have not been clearly spelled out and
                  experimentally demonstrated. This paper fills this gap for
                  task-specific approaches: starting from well-known results in
                  multi-objective optimisation, we discuss how to tackle
                  commonly recognised problems in evolutionary robotics. In
                  particular, we show that multi-objective optimisation (i)
                  allows evolving a more varied set of behaviours by exploring
                  multiple trade-offs of the objectives to optimise, (ii)
                  supports the evolution of the desired behaviour through the
                  introduction of objectives as proxies, (iii) avoids the
                  premature convergence to local optima possibly introduced by
                  multi-component fitness functions, and (iv) solves the
                  bootstrap problem exploiting ancillary objectives to guide
                  evolution in the early phases. We present an experimental
                  demonstration of these benefits in three different case
                  studies: maze navigation in a single robot domain, flocking
                  in a swarm robotics context, and a strictly collaborative
                  task in collective robotics.",

  abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.}

                  optimize a safety-constrained Markov Decision
                  Process(MDP). In this setting, the agent must maximize
                  discounted cumulative reward while constraining the
                  probability of entering unsafe states, defined using a safety
                  function being within some tolerance. The safety values of
                  all states are not known a priori, and we probabilistically
                  model them via a Gaussian Process (GP) prior. As such,
                  properly behaving in such an environment requires balancing a
                  three-way trade-off of exploring the safety function,
                  exploring the reward function, and exploiting acquired
                  knowledge to maximize reward. We propose a novel approach to
                  balance this trade-off. Specifically, our approach explores
                  unvisited states selectively; that is, it prioritizes the
                  exploration of a state if visiting that state significantly
                  improves the knowledge on the achievable cumulative
                  reward. Our approach relies on a novel information gain
                  criterion based on Gaussian Process representations of the
                  reward and safety functions. We demonstrate the effectiveness
                  of our approach on a range of experiments, including a
                  simulation using the real Martian terrain data.},

  abstract =     "The Eternity II (EII) puzzle is a commercial edge matching
                  puzzle in which 256 square tiles with four coloured edges
                  must be arranged on a 16 by 16 grid such that all tile edges
                  are matched. In addition, a complete solution requires that
                  the `grey' patterns, which appear only on a subset of the
                  tiles, should be matched to the outer edges of the grid. The
                  puzzle belongs to the more general class of Edge Matching
                  Puzzles, which have been shown to be NP-complete. In July
                  2007, toy distributor Tomy UK Ltd. released this challenging
                  edge matching puzzle with a \$2 million prize. However, to
                  the best of our knowledge, no complete solution has ever been
                  found. Meanwhile, the final scrutiny date for the cash price,
                  31 December 2010, has passed, leaving the large money prize
                  unclaimed. In its 10 years of existence many people tried to
                  solve EII and some are still trying. Many approaches to Edge
                  Matching Puzzles are reported in the literature. Among these
                  approaches are constraint programming and backtracking,
                  metaheuristics, and evolutionary methods. Other approaches
                  translate the problem into SAT, MILP or max-clique and then
                  solve it with appropriate state of the art solvers. Some
                  approaches have also been implemented on parallel computing
                  or dedicated hardware."

  abstract =     {We investigate how to learn a kernel matrix for high
                  dimensional data that lies on or near a low dimensional
                  manifold. Noting that the kernel matrix implicitly maps the
                  data into a nonlinear feature space, we show how to discover
                  a mapping that "unfolds" the underlying manifold from which
                  the data was sampled. The kernel matrix is constructed by
                  maximizing the variance in feature space subject to local
                  constraints that preserve the angles and distances between
                  nearest neighbors. The main optimization involves an instance
                  of semidefinite programming---a fundamentally different
                  computation than previous algorithms for manifold learning,
                  such as Isomap and locally linear embedding. The optimized
                  kernels perform better than polynomial and Gaussian kernels
                  for problems in manifold learning, but worse for problems in
                  large margin classification. We explain these results in
                  terms of the geometric properties of different kernels and
                  comment on various interpretations of other manifold learning
                  algorithms as kernel methods.},

  abstract =     {Kriging is one of the most used spatial estimation methods in
                  real-world applications. Some kriging parameters must be
                  estimated in order to reach a good accuracy in the
                  interpolation process, however, this task remains a
                  challenge. Various optimization methods have been tested to
                  find good parameters of the kriging process. In recent years,
                  many authors are using bio-inspired techniques and achieving
                  good results in estimating these parameters in comparison
                  with traditional techniques. This paper presents a comparison
                  between well known bio-inspired techniques such as Genetic
                  Algorithms and Particle Swarm Optimization in the estimation
                  of the essential kriging parameters: nugget, sill, range,
                  angle, and factor. In order to perform the tests, we proposed
                  a methodology based on the cluster-based kriging
                  method. Considering the Friedman test, the results showed no
                  statistical difference between the evaluated algorithms in
                  optimizing kriging parameters. On the other hand, the
                  Particle Swarm Optimization approach presented a faster
                  convergence, which is important in this high-cost
                  computational problem.},
