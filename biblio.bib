%% READ THESE RULES FIRST BEFORE MODIFYING THIS FILE
%% 1. Keep the entries sorted with respect to the key.
%% 2. Check that what you are adding has not been added already with a
%%    different name.
%% 3. 'author' and 'editor' fields should be taken from authors.bib.
%% 4. 'publishers', 'series' and 'institution' should be taken from abbrev.bib.
%% 5. 'journal' should be taken from journal.bib.
%% 6. 'InProceedings', 'InCollection' and 'InBook' should take cross-references
%%    from crossref.bib
%% 7. The 'alias' field is used when a repeated entry is found.
%%    Delete one and add its key as the alias field of the other.
%%    This helps to locate entries that have been renamed or deleted.
%% 8. Always use quotes "" instead of braces {} for the string definition.
%% 9. Articles in proceedings published as books (e.g., LNCS) should use
%%    InCollection type.
%%10. InBook should be used ONLY for books where chapters do not have titles.
%%11. Since some bib-styles mandate title-case but others mandate sentence-case
%%    and converting from title-case to sentence-case is done automatically but
%%    the opposite cannot be done, then titles should preferably be in
%%    title-case like "Data Structures and Algorithms". If a word or a letter
%%    should always be in upper (or lower) case, then surround them with
%%    braces, like in "The {ACO} Book", or "The {P}areto Front".
%%12. The fields 'pdf' and 'supplement' can be used to point out to a preferred
%%    PDF filename and a url containing supplementary material respectively.
%%    These fields will be ignored by most BibTeX styles (.bst files), but
%%    they can be used with custom styles to, for example, generate an HTML
%%    bibliography, a list of publications. See testbib.tex for an example.
%% Z. Some of the entries do not follow the above rules.
%%    Please help us to update them little by little.

                  is still a challenging task, in spite of increasing
                  computational power and faster algorithms. In this
                  paper a new approach combining an ant-based
                  algorithm with an exact solver for (mixed-integer)
                  linear programs is presented. A {MAX-MIN} ant system
                  is developed to determine the principal production
                  decisions, a {LP/MIP} solver is used to calculate
                  the corresponding production quantities and
                  inventory levels. Two different local search methods
                  and an improvement strategy based on reduced
                  mixed-integer problems are developed and integrated
                  into the ant algorithm. This hybrid approach
                  provides superior results for small and medium-sized
                  problems in comparison to the existing approaches in
                  the literature. For large-scale problems the
                  performance of this method is among the best.},

  abstract =     {Consider the following restricted (symmetric or
                  asymmetric) traveling-salesman problem {(TSP):}
                  given an initial ordering of the n cities and an
                  integer k {\textgreater} 0, find a minimum-cost
                  feasible tour, where a feasible tour is one in which
                  city i precedes city j whenever j >= i + k in the
                  initial ordering. Balas (1996) has proposed a
                  dynamic-programming algorithm that solves this
                  problem in time linear in n, though exponential in
                  k. Some important real-world problems are amenable
                  to this model or some of its close relatives. The
                  algorithm of Balas (1996) constructs a layered
                  network with a layer of nodes for each position in
                  the tour, such that source-sink paths in this
                  network are in one-to-one correspondence with tours
                  that satisfy the postulated precedence
                  constraints. In this paper we discuss an
                  implementation of the dynamic-programming algorithm
                  for the general case when the integer k is replaced
                  with city-specific integers k(j), j = 1, . . .,
                  n. We discuss applications to, and computational
                  experience with, {TSPs} with time windows, a model
                  frequently used in vehicle routing as well as in
                  scheduling with setup, release and delivery
                  times. We also introduce a new model, the {TSP} with
                  target times, applicable to {Just-in-Time}
                  scheduling problems. Finally for {TSPs} that have no
                  precedence restrictions, we use the algorithm as a
                  heuristic that finds in linear time a local optimum
                  over an exponential-size neighborhood. For this
                  case, we implement an iterated version of our
                  procedure, based on contracting some arcs of the
                  tour produced by a first application of the
                  algorithm, then reapplying the algorithm to the
                  shrunken graph with the same k.},

                  used strategies for hyper-parameter
                  optimization. This paper shows empirically and
                  theoretically that randomly chosen trials are more
                  efficient for hyper-parameter optimization than
                  trials on a grid. Empirical evidence comes from a
                  comparison with a large previous study that used
                  grid search and manual search to configure neural
                  networks and deep belief networks. Compared with
                  neural networks configured by a pure grid search, we
                  find that random search over the same domain is able
                  to find models that are as good or better within a
                  small fraction of the computation time. Granting
                  random search the same computational budget, random
                  search finds better models by effectively searching
                  a larger, less promising configuration
                  space. Compared with deep belief networks configured
                  by a thoughtful combination of manual search and
                  grid search, purely random search over the same
                  32-dimensional configuration space found
                  statistically equal performance on four of seven
                  data sets, and superior performance on one of
                  seven. A Gaussian process analysis of the function
                  from hyper-parameters to validation set performance
                  reveals that for most data sets only a few of the
                  hyper-parameters really matter, but that different
                  hyper-parameters are important on different data
                  sets. This phenomenon makes grid search a poor
                  choice for configuring algorithms for new data
                  sets. Our analysis casts some light on why recent
                  "High Throughput" methods achieve surprising
                  success−they appear to search through a large number
                  of hyper-parameters because most hyper-parameters do
                  not matter much. We anticipate that growing interest
                  in large hierarchical models will place an
                  increasing burden on techniques for hyper-parameter
                  optimization; this work shows that random search is
                  a natural baseline against which to judge progress
                  in the development of adaptive (sequential)
                  hyper-parameter optimization algorithms.},

  abstract =     {The goal of multi-objective optimization is to find
                  a set of best compromise solutions for typically
                  conflicting objectives. Due to the complex nature of
                  most real-life problems, only an approximation to
                  such an optimal set can be obtained within
                  reasonable (computing) time. To compare such
                  approximations, and thereby the performance of
                  multi-objective optimizers providing them, unary
                  quality measures are usually applied. Among these,
                  the \emph{hypervolume indicator} (or
                  \emph{S-metric}) is of particular relevance due to
                  its favorable properties. Moreover, this indicator
                  has been successfully integrated into stochastic
                  optimizers, such as evolutionary algorithms, where
                  it serves as a guidance criterion for finding good
                  approximations to the Pareto front.\\ Recent results
                  show that computing the hypervolume indicator can be
                  seen as solving a specialized version of Klee's
                  Measure Problem.  In general, Klee's Measure Problem
                  can be solved with $\mathcal{O}(n \log n +
                  n^{d/2}\log n)$ comparisons for an input instance of
                  size $n$ in $d$ dimensions; as of this writing, it
                  is unknown whether a lower bound higher than
                  $\Omega(n \log n)$ can be proven.\\ In this article,
                  we derive a lower bound of $\Omega(n\log n)$ for the
                  complexity of computing the hypervolume indicator in
                  any number of dimensions $d>1$ by reducing the
                  so-called \textsc{UniformGap} problem to it.  For
                  the three dimensional case, we also present a
                  matching upper bound of $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$
                  comparisons that is obtained by extending an
                  algorithm for finding the maxima of a point set.},

                  classical string problem that concerns finding the
                  common part of a set of strings. It has several
                  important applications, for example, pattern
                  recognition or computational biology. Most research
                  efforts up to now have focused on solving this
                  problem optimally. In comparison, only few works
                  exist dealing with heuristic approaches. In this
                  work we present a deterministic beam search
                  algorithm. The results show that our algorithm
                  outperforms the current state-of-the-art approaches
                  not only in solution quality but often also in
                  computation time.},

                  version ({MRCPSP).} The objective function
                  considered is minimisation of the makespan. The
                  conventional {SA} search scheme is replaced by a new
                  design that takes into account the specificity of
                  the solution space of project scheduling
                  problems. For {RCPSP}, the search was based on an
                  alternated activity and time incrementing process,
                  and all parameters were set after preliminary
                  statistical experiments done on test instances. For
                  {MRCPSP}, we introduced an original approach using
                  two embedded search loops alternating activity and
                  mode neighbourhood exploration. The performance
                  evaluation done on the benchmark instances available
                  in the literature proved the efficiency of both
                  adaptations that are currently among the most
                  competitive algorithms for these problems.},

  abstract =     {Many real-world optimization problems can be
                  modelled as combinatorial optimization
                  problems. Often, these problems are characterized by
                  their large size and the presence of multiple,
                  conflicting objectives. Despite progress in solving
                  multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems
                  exactly, the large size often means that heuristics
                  are required for their solution in acceptable time.
                  Since the middle of the nineties the trend is
                  towards heuristics that ``pick and choose'' elements
                  from several of the established metaheuristic
                  schemes. Such hybrid approximation techniques may
                  even combine exact and heuristic approaches. In this
                  chapter we give an overview over approximation
                  methods in multi-objective combinatorial
                  optimization. We briefly summarize ``classical''
                  metaheuristics and focus on recent approaches, where
                  metaheuristics are hybridized and/or combined with
                  exact methods.  },

                  non-dominated vectors in d ≥ 2 dimensions, the
                  hypervolume contribution of a point y ∈ Y is the
                  difference between the hypervolume indicator of Y

                  the time complexity is bounded below by Ω(n
                  logn). Moreover, complexity bounds are derived for
                  computing a single hypervolume contribution. A
                  dimension sweep algorithm with time complexity
                  {\textbackslash}{mathcal\{O\}} (n logn) and space
                  complexity {TeX{\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(n)} is
                  proposed for computing all hypervolume contributions
                  in three dimensions. It improves the complexity of
                  the best known algorithm for d = 3 by a factor of
                  {TeX{\textbackslash}sqrt\{n\}} . Theoretical results
                  are complemented by performance tests on randomly
                  generated test-problems.},

                  challenging task. We investigate an evolutionary
                  approach to automating the discovery of new local
                  search heuristics for {SAT.} We show that several
                  well-known {SAT} local search algorithms such as
                  Walksat and Novelty are composite heuristics that
                  are derived from novel combinations of a set of
                  building blocks. Based on this observation, we
                  developed {CLASS}, a genetic programming system that
                  uses a simple composition operator to automatically
                  discover {SAT} local search heuristics. New
                  heuristics discovered by {CLASS} are shown to be
                  competitive with the best Walksat variants,
                  including Novelty+. Evolutionary algorithms have
                  previously been applied to directly evolve a
                  solution for a particular {SAT} instance. We show
                  that the heuristics discovered by {CLASS} are also
                  competitive with these previous, direct evolutionary
                  approaches for {SAT.} We also analyze the local
                  search behavior of the learned heuristics using the
                  depth, mobility, and coverage metrics proposed by
                  Schuurmans and Southey.},

                  offline training sequence, which can be
                  prohibitively expensive. In recent work, we adopted
                  an online approach, in which models of the runtime
                  distributions of the available algorithms are
                  iteratively updated and used to guide the allocation
                  of computational resources, while solving a sequence
                  of problem instances. The models are estimated using
                  survival analysis techniques, which allow us to
                  reduce computation time, censoring the runtimes of
                  the slower algorithms. Here, we review the
                  statistical aspects of our online selection method,
                  discussing the bias induced in the runtime
                  distributions (RTD) models by the competition of
                  different algorithms on the same problem instances.},

  abstract =     {The customer order scheduling problem {(COSP)} is
                  defined as to determine the sequence of tasks to
                  satisfy the demand of customers who order several
                  types of products produced on a single machine. A
                  setup is required whenever a product type is
                  launched.  The objective of the scheduling problem
                  is to minimize the average customer order flow
                  time. Since the customer order scheduling problem is
                  known to be strongly {NP-hard,} we solve it using
                  four major metaheuristics and compare the
                  performance of these heuristics, namely, simulated
                  annealing, genetic algorithms, tabu search, and ant
                  colony optimization. These are selected to represent
                  various characteristics of metaheuristics:
                  nature-inspired vs. artificially created,
                  population-based vs. local search, etc. A set of
                  problems is generated to compare the solution
                  quality and computational efforts of these
                  heuristics.  Results of the experimentation show
                  that tabu search and ant colony perform better for
                  large problems whereas simulated annealing performs
                  best in small-size problems. Some conclusions are
                  also drawn on the interactions between various
                  problem parameters and the performance of the
                  heuristics.  },

  abstract =     "This paper deals with minimizing the total cost of
                  pumping in a liquid pipeline. Previous experience
                  with the most common solution procedures in pipeline
                  optimization is discussed along with their strengths
                  and weaknesses. The proposed method is an
                  evolutionary algorithm with two distinct features:
                  (1) The search is restricted to feasible region
                  only; and (2) it utilizes a floating point decision
                  variable rather than integer or binary as is the
                  case with most other similar approaches. A numerical
                  example is presented as a basis for verification of
                  the proposed method and its comparison with the
                  existing solver that utilizes the nonlinear
                  Newtonian search. The proposed method provides
                  promising improvements in terms of optimality when
                  compared to the widespread gradient search methods
                  because it does not involve evaluation of the
                  gradient of the objective function. It also provides
                  potential to improve the performance of previous
                  evolutionary programs because it restricts the
                  search to the feasible region, thus eliminating
                  large overhead associated with generation and
                  inspection of solutions that are
                  infeasible. Comparison of the two solutions revealed
                  improvement of the solution in favor of the proposed
                  algorithm, which ranged up to 6\% depending on the
                  initial values of the decision variables in the
                  Newtonian search. The proposed method was not
                  sensitive to the starting value of the decision
                  variables.",

                  networks. This study presents a method based on
                  linear programming for determining an optimal
                  (minimum cost) schedule of pumping on a 24-hr
                  basis. Both unit and maximum demand electricity
                  charges are considered. Account is taken of the
                  relative efficiencies of the available pumps, the
                  structure of the electricity tariff, the
                  consumer-demand profile, and the hydraulic
                  characteristics and operational constraints of the
                  network. The use of extended-period simulation of
                  the network operation in determining the parameters
                  of the linearized network equations and constraints
                  and in studying the optimized network operation is
                  described. An application of the method to an
                  existing network in the United Kingdom is presented,
                  showing that considerable savings are possible. The
                  method was found to be robust and with low
                  computation-time requirements, and is therefore
                  suitable for real-time implementation.",

                  finding a set of paths from the starting point to
                  the ending point such that the total collected
                  reward received from visiting a subset of locations
                  is maximized and the length of each path is
                  restricted by a pre-specified limit. In this paper,
                  an ant colony optimization {(ACO)} approach is
                  proposed for the team orienteering problem. Four
                  methods, i.e., the sequential,
                  deterministic-concurrent and random-concurrent and
                  simultaneous methods, are proposed to construct
                  candidate solutions in the framework of {ACO.} We
                  compare these methods according to the results
                  obtained on well-known problems from the
                  literature. Finally, we compare the algorithm with
                  several existing algorithms. The results show that
                  our algorithm is promising.},

                  ({RCPSP).} It provides an update of our survey which
                  was published in 2000. We summarize and categorize a
                  large number of heuristics that have recently been
                  proposed in the literature. Most of these heuristics
                  are then evaluated in a computational study and
                  compared on the basis of our standardized
                  experimental design. Based on the computational
                  results we discuss features of good heuristics. The
                  paper closes with some remarks on our test design
                  and a summary of the recent developments in research
                  on heuristics for the {RCPSP.}},

  abstract =     {Application of heuristic solution procedures to the
                  practical problem of project scheduling has
                  previously been studied by numerous
                  researchers. However, there is little consensus
                  about their findings, and the practicing manager is
                  currently at a loss as to which scheduling rule to
                  use. Furthermore, since no categorization process
                  was developed, it is assumed that once a rule is
                  selected it must be used throughout the whole
                  project. This research breaks away from this
                  tradition by providing a categorization process
                  based on two powerful project summary measures. The
                  first measure identifies the location of the peak of
                  total resource requirements and the second measure
                  identifies the rate of utilization of each resource
                  type. The performance of the rules are classified
                  according to values of these two measures, and it is
                  shown that a rule introduced by this research
                  performs significantly better on most categories of
                  projects.},

                  a difficult optimization problem that arises, for
                  example, in logistics. This paper deals with the
                  minimization of the travel-cost. For solving this
                  problem, this paper proposes a Beam-ACO algorithm,
                  which is a hybrid method combining ant colony
                  optimization with beam search.  In general, Beam-ACO
                  algorithms heavily rely on accurate and
                  computationally inexpensive bounding information for
                  differentiating between partial solutions. This work
                  uses stochastic sampling as a useful alternative. An
                  extensive experimental evaluation on seven benchmark
                  sets from the literature shows that the proposed
                  Beam-ACO algorithm is currently a state-of-the-art
                  technique for the travelling salesman problem with
                  time windows when travel-cost optimization is
                  concerned.},

  abstract =     {In this paper, we examine the problem of maintaining
                  an approximation of the set of nondominated points
                  visited during a multiobjective optimization, a
                  problem commonly known as archiving. Most of the
                  currently available archiving algorithms are
                  reviewed, and what is known about their convergence
                  and approximation properties is summarized. The main
                  scenario considered is the restricted case where the
                  archive must be updated online as points are
                  generated one by one, and at most a fixed number of
                  points are to be stored in the archive at any one
                  time. In this scenario, the better-monotonicity of
                  an archiving algorithm is proposed as a weaker, but
                  more practical, property than negative efficiency
                  preservation. This paper shows that
                  hypervolume-based archivers and a recently proposed
                  multi-level grid archiver have this property. On the
                  other hand, the archiving methods used by SPEA2 and
                  NSGA-II do not, and they may better-deteriorate with
                  time. The better-monotonicity property has meaning
                  on any input sequence of points. We also classify
                  archivers according to limit properties,
                  i.e. convergence and approximation properties of the
                  archiver in the limit of infinite (input) samples
                  from a finite space with strictly positive
                  generation probabilities for all points. This paper
                  establishes a number of research questions, and
                  provides the initial framework and analysis for
                  answering them.},

  abstract =     {Reducing the energy consumption of water
                  distribution networks has never had more
                  significance. The greatest energy savings can be
                  obtained by carefully scheduling the operations of
                  pumps. Schedules can be defined either implicitly,
                  in terms of other elements of the network such as
                  tank levels, or explicitly by specifying the time
                  during which each pump is on/off.  The traditional
                  representation of explicit schedules is a string of
                  binary values with each bit representing pump on/off
                  status during a particular time interval.  In this
                  paper, we formally define and analyze two new
                  explicit representations based on time-controlled
                  triggers, where the maximum number of pump switches
                  is established beforehand and the schedule may
                  contain less switches than the maximum. In these
                  representations, a pump schedule is divided into a
                  series of integers with each integer representing
                  the number of hours for which a pump is
                  active/inactive.  This reduces the number of
                  potential schedules compared to the binary
                  representation, and allows the algorithm to operate
                  on the feasible region of the search space.  We
                  propose evolutionary operators for these two new
                  representations. The new representations and their
                  corresponding operations are compared with the two
                  most-used representations in pump scheduling,
                  namely, binary representation and level-controlled
                  triggers. A detailed statistical analysis of the
                  results indicates which parameters have the greatest
                  effect on the performance of evolutionary
                  algorithms. The empirical results show that an
                  evolutionary algorithm using the proposed
                  representations improves over the results obtained
                  by a recent state-of-the-art Hybrid Genetic
                  Algorithm for pump scheduling using level-controlled
                  triggers.}

Multi-objective optimization problems are problems with several,
typically conflicting criteria for evaluating solutions. Without
any a priori preference information, the Pareto optimality
principle establishes a partial order among solutions, and the
output of the algorithm becomes a set of nondominated solutions
rather than a single one. Various ant colony optimization (ACO)
algorithms have been proposed in recent years for solving such
problems. These multi-objective ACO (MOACO) algorithms exhibit
different design choices for dealing with the particularities of
the multi-objective context. This paper proposes a formulation of
algorithmic components that suffices to describe most MOACO
algorithms proposed so far. This formulation also shows that
existing MOACO algorithms often share equivalent design choices
but they are described in different terms. Moreover, this
formulation is synthesized into a flexible algorithmic framework,
from which not only existing MOACO algorithms may be
instantiated, but also combinations of components that were never
studied in the literature. In this sense, this paper goes beyond
proposing a new MOACO algorithm, but it rather introduces a
family of MOACO algorithms. The flexibility of the proposed MOACO
framework facilitates the application of automatic algorithm
configuration techniques. The experimental results presented in
this paper show that the automatically configured MOACO framework
outperforms the MOACO algorithms that inspired the framework
itself. This paper is also among the first to apply automatic
algorithm configuration techniques to multi-objective algorithms.}

                  to a project is limited and not sufficient to
                  execute all the concurrent activities. In this
                  situation, decision making about their schedule is
                  necessary. Many times this schedule supposes an
                  increase in the project completion
                  time. Additionally, companies commonly manage
                  various projects simultaneously, sharing a pool of
                  renewable resources. Given these resource
                  constraints, we often can only apply heuristic
                  methods to solve the scheduling problem. In this
                  work the effect of the schedule generation schemes –
                  serial or parallel – and priority rules – {MINLFT},
                  {MINSLK}, {MAXTWK}, {SASP} or {FCFS} – with two
                  approaches – multi-project and single-project – are

                  project delay and the multiproject duration

                  results show that with the parallel scheduling

                  minimising mean project delay or minimising

                  based on priority rules with a two-phase approach –

                  minimise mean project delay with a multi-project

                  Problem ({MRCPSP)} aims at finding the start times
                  and execution modes for the activities of a project
                  that optimize a given objective function while
                  verifying a set of precedence and resource
                  constraints. In this paper, we focus on this problem
                  and develop a hybrid Genetic Algorithm ({MM-HGA)} to
                  solve it. Its main contributions are the mode
                  assignment procedure, the fitness function and the
                  use of a very efficient improving method. Its
                  performance is demonstrated by extensive
                  computational results obtained on a set of standard
                  instances and against the best currently available
                  algorithms.},

                  phase of the method, an initial population composed
                  of a good approximation of the extreme supported
                  efficient solutions is generated. We use as second
                  phase a {P}areto Local Search method applied to each

                  is a partially discrete non-linear problem with many
                  variables. The scheduling method described in this
                  paper typically produces costs within 1\% of a
                  linear program-based solution, and can incorporate
                  realistic non-linear costs that may be hard to
                  incorporate in linear programming
                  formulations. These costs include pump switching and
                  maximum demand charges. A simplified model is
                  derived from a standard hydraulic simulator. An
                  initial schedule is produced by a descent
                  method. Two-stage simulated annealing then produces
                  solutions in a few minutes. Iterative recalibration
                  ensures that the solution agrees closely with the
                  results from a full hydraulic simulation.",

                  for solving nonlinear multiobjective optimization
                  problems. In interactive methods, a decision maker
                  plays an important part and the idea is to support
                  her/him in the search for the most preferred
                  solution. In interactive methods, steps of an
                  iterative solution algorithm are repeated and the
                  decision maker progressively provides preference
                  information so that the most preferred solution can
                  be found. We identify three types of specifying
                  preference information in interactive methods and
                  give some examples of methods representing each
                  type. The types are methods based on trade-off
                  information, reference points and classification of

  abstract =     { This paper studies the learning process in an ant
                  colony optimization algorithm designed to solve the
                  problem of ordering cars on an assembly line
                  (car-sequencing problem). This problem has been
                  shown to be {NP-hard} and evokes a great deal of
                  interest among practitioners. Learning in an ant
                  algorithm is achieved by using an artificial
                  pheromone trail, which is a central element of this
                  metaheuristic. Many versions of the algorithm are
                  found in literature, the main distinction among them
                  being the management of the pheromone
                  trail. Nevertheless, few of them seek to perfect
                  learning by modifying the internal structure of the
                  trail. In this paper, a new pheromone trail
                  structure is proposed that is specifically adapted
                  to the type of constraints in the car-sequencing
                  problem. The quality of the results obtained when
                  solving three sets of benchmark problems is superior
                  to that of the best solutions found in literature
                  and shows the efficiency of the specialized trail.},

                  chlorination stations, under unsteady
                  hydraulics. The objective is to minimize the total
                  cost of operating the pumping units and the chlorine
                  booster operation and design for a selected
                  operational time horizon, while delivering the

                  decision variables, for each of the time steps that
                  encompass the total operational time horizon,
                  include: the scheduling of the pumping units,
                  settings of the water distribution system control
                  valves, and the mass injection rates at each of the
                  booster chlorination stations. The constraints are
                  domain heads and chlorine concentrations at the
                  consumer nodes, maximum injection rates at the
                  chlorine injection stations, maximum allowable
                  amounts of water withdraws at the sources, and
                  returning at the end of the operational time horizon
                  to a prescribed total volume in the tanks. The model

                  timetabling and course timetabling
                  problems. Usually, these problems are characterized

                  on goals and priorities. Various aspects of
                  evolutionary algorithms are proposed and studied for

                  types and parameters of mutation operator. The
                  choice of both representation and operators is made

                  with respect to others at the level of the

                  performance is presented for the proposed algorithms
                  by means of statistical inference, based on real
                  problems of the University of Algarve. The notion of

                  assessment of performance of multiobjective
                  evolutionary algorithms. Finally, the evolution of
                  the solution cost during the runs is analysed by

  ABSTRACT =     "The measure of the region dominated by (the maxima
                  of) a set of $n$ points in the positive $d$-orthant
                  has been proposed as an indicator of performance in
                  multiobjective optimization, known as the
                  hypervolume indicator, and the problem of computing
                  it efficiently is attracting increasing
                  attention. In this report, this problem is
                  formulated as a special case of Klee's measure
                  problem in $d$ dimensions, which immediately
                  establishes $O(n^{d/2}\log n)$ as a, possibly
                  conservative, upper bound on the required
                  computation time. Then, an $O(n log n)$ algorithm
                  for the 3-dimensional version of this special case
                  is constructed, based on an existing dimension-sweep
                  algorithm for the related maxima problem. Finally,
                  $O(n log n)$ is shown to remain a lower bound on the
                  time required by the hypervolume indicator for

                  each playing some specific role with respect to
                  overall performance. This article explores the

                  that there exists a strong dependence between the

                  the static and dynamic maximum satisfiability
                  problems {(MAX-SAT).} In the first part of the
                  chapter we give an introduction to meta-heuristics
                  in general and ant colony optimization in
                  particular, followed by an introduction to
                  constraint satisfaction and static and dynamic
                  constraint satisfaction optimization problems.
                  Then, we describe how to apply the {ACO} algorithm
                  to the problems, and do an analysis of the results
                  obtained for several benchmarks.  The adapted ant
                  colony optimization accomplishes very well the task
                  of dealing with systematic changes of dynamic
                  {MAX-SAT} instances derived from static problems.  },

                  problems called ant system for multi-level
                  lot-sizing algorithm {(ASMLLS).} We apply a hybrid
                  approach where we use ant colony optimization in
                  order to find a good lot-sizing sequence, i.e. a
                  sequence of the different items in the product
                  structure in which we apply a modified
                  {Wagner-Whitin} algorithm for each item
                  separately. Based on the setup costs each ant
                  generates a sequence of items. Afterwards a simple
                  single-stage lot-sizing rule is applied with
                  modified setup costs. This modification of the setup
                  costs depends on the position of the item in the
                  lot-sizing sequence, on the items which have been
                  lot-sized before, and on two further parameters,
                  which are tried to be improved by a systematic
                  search. For small-sized problems {ASMLLS} is among
                  the best algorithms, but for most medium- and
                  large-sized problems it outperforms all other
                  approaches regarding solution quality as well as
                  computational time.},

                  {NP-hard,} we propose a hybrid ant colony
                  optimization {(ACO)} algorithm to tackle it
                  heuristically. The algorithm exploits two important
                  problem characteristics: (i) the {CMST} problem is
                  closely related to the capacitated vehicle routing
                  problem {(CVRP),} and (ii) given a clustering of
                  client nodes that satisfies capacity constraints,
                  the solution is to find a {MST} for each cluster,
                  which can be done exactly in polynomial time. Our
                  {ACO} exploits these two characteristics of the
                  {CMST} by a solution construction originally
                  developed for the {CVRP.} Given the {CVRP} solution,
                  we then apply an implementation of Prim's algorithm
                  to each cluster to obtain a feasible {CMST}
                  solution. Results from a comprehensive computational
                  study indicate the efficiency and effectiveness of
                  the proposed approach.},

                  techniques for the multi-objective orienteering
                  problem are developed. The motivation stems from the
                  problem of planning individual tourist routes in a
                  city. Each point of interest in a city provides
                  different benefits for different categories (e.g.,
                  culture, shopping). Each tourist has different
                  preferences for the different categories when
                  selecting and visiting the points of interests
                  (e.g., museums, churches). Hence, a multi-objective
                  decision situation arises.  To determine all the
                  Pareto optimal solutions, two metaheuristic search
                  techniques are developed and applied. We use the
                  Pareto ant colony optimization algorithm and extend
                  the design of the variable neighborhood search
                  method to the multi-objective case. Both methods are
                  hybridized with path relinking procedures. The
                  performances of the two algorithms are tested on
                  several benchmark instances as well as on real world
                  instances from different Austrian regions and the
                  cities of Vienna and Padua.  The computational
                  results show that both implemented methods are well
                  performing algorithms to solve the multi-objective
                  orienteering problem.},

  abstract =     "Operation of pumping stations represents high costs
                  to water supply companies. Therefore, reducing such
                  costs through an optimal pump scheduling becomes an
                  important issue. This work presents the use of
                  Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) to
                  solve an optimal pump-scheduling problem. For the
                  first time, six different approaches were
                  implemented and compared. These algorithms aim to
                  minimise four objectives: electric energy cost,
                  pumps' maintenance cost, maximum power peak, and
                  level variation in the reservoir. In order to
                  consider hydraulic and technical constrains, a
                  heuristic constrain algorithm was developed and
                  combined with each MOEA utilised. Evaluation of
                  experimental results of a set of metrics shows that
                  the Strength {P}areto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA)
                  achieves the best performance for this
                  problem. Moreover, SPEA's set of solutions provide
                  pumping station operation engineers with a wide
                  range of optimal pump schedules to chose from."

                  is on a formal definition of semi-active, active,
                  and non-delay schedules. Traditionally these
                  schedules establish basic concepts within the job
                  shop scheduling literature. There they are usually
                  defined in a rather informal way which does not
                  create any substantial problems. Using these
                  concepts in the more general {RCPSP} without giving
                  a formal definition may cause serious
                  problems. After providing a formal definition of
                  semi-active, active, and non-delay schedules for the
                  {RCPSP} we outline some of these problems occurring
